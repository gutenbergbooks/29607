<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">C</span><span class="dcap">onfound</span> it, Carnes, I am
on my vacation!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Doctor, and I
hate to disturb you, but I
felt that I simply had to. I have one
of the weirdest cases on my hands that
I have ever been
mixed up in and
I think that you&#8217;ll
forgive me for
calling you when
I tell you about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>How could a human body be found
actually splintered&ndash;&ndash;broken into sharp
fragments like a shattered glass! Once
again Dr. Bird probes deep into an
amazing mystery.</p>
<p>Dr. Bird groaned
into the telephone transmitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took a vacation last summer, or
tried to, and you hauled me away from
the best fishing I have found in years
to help you on a case. This year I
traveled all the way from Washington
to San Francisco to get away from you
and the very day that I get here you
are after me. I won&#8217;t have anything to
do with it. Where are you, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am at Fallon, Nevada, Doctor.
I&#8217;m sorry that you won&#8217;t help me out
because the case
promises to be
unusually interesting.
Let me at least tell you
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Bird groaned
louder than
ever into the telephone transmitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, go ahead and tell me about
it if it will relieve your mind, but I
have given you my final answer. I am
not a bit interested in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is quite all right, Doctor, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
don&#8217;t expect you to touch it. I hope,
however, that you will be able to give
me an idea of where to start. Did
you ever see a man&#8217;s body broken in
pieces?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean badly smashed up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed, I mean just what I said,
broken in pieces. Legs snapped off as
though the entire flesh had become
brittle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, and neither did anyone
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen it, Doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooey! What had you been drinking?&#8221;</p>
<p>Operative Carnes of the United
States Secret Service chuckled softly
to himself. The voice of the famous
scientist of the Bureau of Standards
plainly showed an interest which was
quite at variance with his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was quite sober, Doctor, and so
was Hughes, and we both saw it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Hughes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is an air mail pilot, one of the
crack fliers of the Transcontinental
Airmail Corporation. Let me tell you
the whole thing in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I have a few minutes to
spare, but I&#8217;ll warn you again that I
don&#8217;t intend to touch the case.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">S</span><span class="dcap">uit</span> yourself, Doctor. I have no
authority to requisition your services.
As you know, the T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C. has
been handling a great deal of the transcontinental
air mail with a pretty clean
record on accidents. The day before
yesterday, a special plane left Washington
to carry two packages from
there to San Francisco. One of them
was a shipment of jewels valued at a
quarter of a million, consigned to a San
Francisco firm and the other was a
sealed packet from the War Department.
No one was supposed to know
the contents of that packet except the
Chief of Staff who delivered it to the
plane personally, but rumors got out, as
usual, and it was popularly supposed
to contain certain essential features of
the Army&#8217;s war plans. This much is
certain: The plane carried not only the
regular T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C. pilot and courier, but
also an army courier, and it was guarded
during the trip by an army plane
armed with small bombs and a machine-gun.
I rode in it. My orders were
simply to guard the ship until it landed
at Mills Field and then to guard the
courier from there to the Presidio of
San Francisco until his packet was delivered
personally into the hands of
the Commanding General of the Ninth
Corps Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trip was quiet and monotonous
until after we left Salt Lake City at
dawn this morning. Nothing happened
until we were about a hundred miles
east of Reno. We had taken elevation
to cross the Stillwater Mountains and
were skimming low over them, my
plane trailing the T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C. plane by
about half a mile. I was not paying
any particular attention to the other
ship when I suddenly felt our plane
leap ahead. It was a fast Douglas and
the pilot gave it the gun and made it
move, I can tell you. I yelled into
the speaking tube and asked what was
the reason. My pilot yelled back that
the plane ahead was in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as it was called to my attention
I could see myself that it wasn&#8217;t
acting normally. It was losing elevation
and was pursuing a very erratic
course. Before we could reach it it
lost flying speed and fell into a spinning
nose dive and headed for the
ground. I watched, expecting every
minute to see the crew make parachute
jumps, but they didn&#8217;t and the plane
hit the ground with a terrific crash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It caught fire, of course?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">N</span><span class="dcap">o,</span> Doctor, that is one of the
funny things about the accident.
It didn&#8217;t. It hit the ground
in an open place free from brush and
literally burst into pieces, but it didn&#8217;t
flame up. We headed directly for the
scene of the crash and we encountered
another funny thing. We almost froze
to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly what I say. Of course, it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
pretty cold at that altitude all the time,
but this cold was like nothing I had
ever encountered. It seemed to freeze
the blood in our veins and it congealed
frost on the windshields and made the
motor miss for a moment. It was only
momentary and it only existed directly
over the wrecked plane. We went past
it and swung around in a circle and
came back over the wreck, but we didn&#8217;t
feel the cold again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next thing we tried to do was
to find a landing place. That country
is pretty rugged and rough and there
wasn&#8217;t a flat place for miles that was
large enough to land a ship on. Hughes
and I talked it over and there didn&#8217;t
seem to be much of anything that we
could do except to go on until we
found a landing place. I had had no
experience in parachute jumping and
I couldn&#8217;t pilot the plane if Hughes
jumped. We swooped down over the
wreck as close as we dared and that
was when we saw the condition of the
bodies. The whole plane was cracked
up pretty badly, but the weird part of
it was the fact that the bodies of the
crew had broken into pieces, as though
they had been made of glass. Arms
and legs were detached from the
torsos and lying at a distance. There
was no sign of blood on the ground.
We saw all this with our naked eyes
from close at hand and verified it by
observations through binoculars from
a greater height.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we had made our observations
and marked the location of the
wreck as closely as we could, we headed
east until we found a landing place
near Fallon. Hughes dropped me here
and went on to Reno, or to San Francisco
if necessary, to report the accident
and get more planes to aid in
the search. I was wholly at sea, but it
seemed to be in your line and as I
knew that you were at the St. Francis,
I called you up.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hat</span> are your plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made none until I talked
with you. The country where the
wreck occurred is unbelievably wild
and we can&#8217;t get near it with any transportation
other than burros. The only
thing that I can see to do is to gather
together what transportation I can and
head for the wreck on foot to rescue
the packets and to bring out the bodies.
Can you suggest anything better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you expect to start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I can get my pack train
together. Possibly in three or four
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carnes, are you sure that those
bodies were broken into bits? An arm
or a leg might easily be torn off in a
complete crash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were smashed into bits as
nearly as I could tell, Doctor. Hughes
is an old flier and he has seen plenty of
crashes but he never saw anything like
this. It beats anything that I ever
saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your observations were accurate,
there could be only one cause and that
one is a patent impossibility. I haven&#8217;t
a bit of equipment here, but I expect
that I can get most of the stuff I want
from the University of California
across the bay at Berkeley. I can get
a plane at Crissy Field. I&#8217;ll tell you
what to do, Carnes. Get your burro
train together and start as soon as you
can, but leave me half a dozen burros
and a guide at Fallon. I&#8217;ll get up there
as soon as I can and I&#8217;ll try to overtake
you before you get to the wreck.
If I don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t disturb anything any
more than you can help until my arrival.
Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that you were on your
vacation, Doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh shut up! Like most of my vacations,
this one will have to be postponed.
I&#8217;ll move as swiftly as I can
and I ought to be at Fallon to-night if
I&#8217;m lucky and don&#8217;t run into any obstacles.
Burros are fairly slow, but I&#8217;ll
make the best time possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather expected you would, Doctor.
I can&#8217;t get my pack train together
until evening, so I&#8217;ll wait for you right
here. I&#8217;m mighty glad that you are going
to get in on it.&#8221;</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Silently</span> Carnes and Dr. Bird
surveyed the wreck of the T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C.
plane. The observations of the secret
service operative had been correct. The
bodies of the unfortunate crew had
been broken into fragments. Their
limbs had not been twisted off as a
freak of the fall but had been cleanly
broken off, as though the bodies had
suddenly become brittle and had shattered
on their impact with the ground.
Not only the bodies, but the ship itself
had been broken up. Even the clothing
of the men was in pieces or had long
splits in the fabric whose edges were
as clean as though they had been cut
with a knife.</p>
<p>Dr. Bird picked up an arm which had
belonged to the pilot and examined it.
The brittleness, if it had ever existed,
was gone and the arm was limp.</p>
<p>&#8220;No <i>rigor mortis</i>,&#8221; commented the
Doctor. &#8220;How long ago was the wreck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About seventy-two hours ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm-m! What about those packets
that were on the plane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Carnes stepped forward and gingerly
inspected first the body of the army
courier and then that of the courier of
the T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both gone, Doctor,&#8221; he reported,
straightening up.</p>
<p>Dr. Bird&#8217;s face fell into grim lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is more to this case than appears
on the surface, Carnes,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;This was no ordinary wreck. Bring
up that third burro; I want to examine
these fragments a little. Bill,&#8221; he went
on to one of the two guides who had
accompanied them from Fallon, &#8220;you
and Walter scout around the ground
and see what you can find out. I especially
wish to know whether anyone

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> guides consulted a moment
and started out. Carnes drove up
the burro the Doctor had indicated and
Dr. Bird unpacked it. He opened a
mahogony case and took from it a high
powered microscope. Setting the instrument
up on a convenient rock, he
subjected portions of the wreck, including
several fragments of flesh, to
a careful scrutiny. When he had completed
his observations he fell into a
brown study, from which he was
aroused by Carnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you find out about the
cause of the wreck, Doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think. The
immediate cause was that everything
was frozen. The plane ran into a belt
of cold which froze up the motor and
which probably killed the crew instantly.
It was undoubtedly the aftermath
of that cold which you felt when you
swooped down over the wreck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems impossible that it could
have suddenly got cold enough to
freeze everything up like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does, and yet I am confident that
that is what happened. It was no ordinary
cold, Carnes; it was cold of the
type that infests interstellar space;
cold beyond any conception you have
of cold, cold near the range of the absolute
zero of temperature, nearly four
hundred and fifty degrees below zero
on the Fahrenheit scale. At such temperatures,
things which are ordinarily
quite flexible and elastic, such as rubber,
or flesh, become as brittle as glass
and would break in the manner which
these bodies have broken. An examination
of the tissues of the flesh shows
that it has been submitted to some temperature
that is very low in the scale,
probably below that of liquid air. Such
a temperature would produce instant
death and the other phenomena which
we can observe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What could cause such a low temperature,
Doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet, although I hope
to find out before we are finished. Cold
is a funny thing, Carnes. Ordinarily
it is considered as simply the absence
of heat; and yet I have always held it
to be a definite negative quantity. All
through nature we observe that every
force has its opposite or negative force
to oppose it. We have positive and
negative electrical charges, positive
and negative, or north and south, magnetic
poles. We have gravity and its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
opposite apergy, and I believe cold is
really negative heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of anything like that,
Doctor. I always thought that things
were cold because heat was taken from
them&ndash;&ndash;not because cold was added. It
sounds preposterous.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">S</span><span class="dcap">uch</span> is the common idea, and yet
I cannot accept it, for it does not
explain all the recorded phenomena.
You are familiar with a searchlight, are
you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a general way, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A searchlight is merely a source of
light, and of course, of heat, which is
placed at the focus of a parabolic reflector
so that all of the rays emanating
from the source travel in parallel lines.
A searchlight, of course, gives off heat.
If we place a lens of the same size as
the searchlight aperture in the path of
the beam and concentrate all the light,
and heat, at one spot, the focal point of
the lens, the temperature at that point
is the same as the temperature of the
source of the light, less what has been
lost by radiation. You understand that,
do you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose that we place at the center
of the aperture of the searchlight a
small opaque disc which is permeable
neither to heat nor light, in such a manner
as to interrupt the central portion
of the beam. As a result, the beam will
go out in the form of a hollow rod, or
pipe, of heat and light with a dark, cold
core. This core will have the temperature
of the surrounding air plus the
small amount which has radiated into
it from the surrounding pipe. If we
now pass this beam of light through a
lens in order to concentrate the beam,
both the pipe of heat and the cold core
will focus. If we place a temperature
measuring device near the focus of the
dark core, we will find that the temperature
is lower than the surrounding
air. This means that we have <a name='TC_1'></a><ins title="Was 'focussed'">focused</ins>
or concentrated cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds impossible. But I can
offer no other criticism.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">N</span><span class="dcap">evertheless</span>, it is experimentally
true. It is one of the
facts which lead me to consider cold as
negative heat. However, this is true of
cold, as it is of the other negative
forces; they exist and manifest themselves
only in the presence of the positive
forces. No one has yet concentrated
cold except in the presence of
heat, as I have outlined. How this cold
belt which the T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C. plane encountered
came to be there is another question.
The thing which we have to determine
is whether it was caused by
natural or artificial forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of the packets which the plane
carried are gone, Doctor,&#8221; observed
Carnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and that seems to add weight
to the possibility that the cause was
artificial, but it is far from conclusive.
The packets might not have been on
the men when the plane fell, or someone
may have passed later and taken
them for safekeeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor&#8217;s remarks were interrupted
by the guides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone has been here since the
wreck, Doctor,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;Walter and
I found tracks where two men came up
here and prowled around for some time
and then left by the way they came.
They went off toward the northwest,
and we followed their trail for about
forty rods and then lost it. We weren&#8217;t
able to pick it up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Bill,&#8221; replied the doctor.
&#8220;Well, Carnes, that seems to add more
weight to the theory that the spot of
cold was made and didn&#8217;t just happen.
If a prospecting party had just happened
along they would either have
left the wreck alone or would have
made some attempt to inter the bodies.
That cold belt must have been produced
artificially by men who planned
to rob this plane after bringing it down
and who were near at hand to get their
plunder. Is there any chance of following
that trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt it, Doc. Walter and I
scouted around quite a little, but we
couldn&#8217;t pick it up again.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is there any power line passing
within twenty miles of here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None that Walter and I know of,
Doc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny! Such a device as must have
been used would need power and lots
of it for operation. Well, I&#8217;ll try my
luck. Carnes, help me unpack and set
up the rest of my apparatus.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">With</span> the aid of the operative,
Dr. Bird unpacked two of the
burros and extracted from cases where
they were carefully packed and padded
some elaborate electrical and optical
apparatus. The first was a short telescope
of large diameter which he
mounted on a base in such a manner
that it could be elevated or depressed
and rotated in any direction. At the
focal point of the telescope was fastened
a small knot of wire from which
one lead ran to the main piece of apparatus,
which he sat on a flat rock.
The other lead from the wire knot ran
into a sealed container surrounded by
a water bath under which a spirit lamp
burned. From the container another
lead led to the main apparatus. This
main piece consisted of a series of wire
coils mounted on a frame and attached
to the two leads. The doctor took from
a padded case a tiny magnet suspended
on a piece of wire of exceedingly small
diameter which he fastened in place inside
the coils. Cemented to the magnet
was a tiny mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that apparatus?&#8221; asked
Carnes as the doctor finished his set-up
and surveyed it with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merely a thermocouple attached to
a D&#8217;Arsonval galvanometer,&#8221; replied
the doctor. &#8220;This large, squat telescope
catches and concentrates on the
thermocouple and the galvanometer
registers the temperature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re out of my depth. What is a
thermocouple?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A juncture of two wires made of
dissimilar metals, in this case of platinum
and of platinum-iridium alloy.
There is another similar junction in
this case, which is kept at a constant
temperature by the water bath. When
the temperatures of the two junctions
are the same, the system is in equilibrium.
When they are at different temperatures,
an electrical potential is set
up, which causes a current to flow from
one to the other through the galvanometer.
The galvanometer consists of a
magnet set up inside coils through
which the current I spoke of flows.
This current causes the magnet to rotate
and by watching the mirror, the
rotation can be detected and measured.</p>
<p>&#8220;This device is one of the most sensitive
ever made, and is used to measure
the radiation from distant stars. Currents
as small as .000000000000000000000000001
ampere have been detected
and measured. This particular instrument
is not that sensitive to begin with,
and has its sensitivity further reduced
by having a high resistance in one of
the leads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to use it for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to try to locate somewhere
in these hills a patch of local
cold. It may not work, but I have
hopes. If you will manipulate the telescope
so as to search the hills around
here, I will watch the galvanometer.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">For</span> several minutes Carnes swung
the telescope around. Twice Dr.
Bird stopped him and decreased the
sensitiveness of his instrument by introducing
more resistance in the lines
in order to keep the magnet from twisting
clear around, due to the fluctuations
in the heats received on account
of the varying conditions of reflection.
As Carnes swung the telescope again
the magnet swung around sharply,
nearly to a right angle to its former
position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried the doctor. &#8220;Read your
azimuth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carnes read the compass bearing on
the protractor attached to the frame
which supported the telescope. Dr.
Bird took a pair of binoculars and
looked long and earnestly in the indicated
direction. With a sigh he laid
down the glasses.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see a thing, Carnesy,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to move over to the
next crest and make a new set-up. Plant
a rod on the hill so that we can get an
azimuth bearing and get the airline
distance with a range finder.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the hilltop which Dr. Bird had
pointed out the apparatus was again set
up. For several minutes Carnes swept
the hills before an exclamation from
the doctor told him to pause. He read
the new azimuth, and the doctor laid
off the two readings on a sheet of paper
with a protractor and made a few calculations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said reflectively
when he had finished his computations.
&#8220;This darned instrument is still so sensitive
that you may have merely focused
on a deep shadow or a cold
spring or something of that sort, but
the magnet kicked clear around and it
may mean that we have located what
we are looking for. It should be about
two miles away and almost due west of
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no spring that I know of,
Doc, and I think I know of every water
hole in this country,&#8221; remarked Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;There could hardly be a spring at
this elevation, anyway,&#8221; replied the
doctor. &#8220;Maybe it is what we are seeking.
We&#8217;ll start out in that direction,
anyway. Bill, you had better take the
lead, for you know the country. Spread
out a little so that we won&#8217;t be too
bunched if anything happens.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">For</span> three-quarters of an hour the
little group of men made their
way through the wilderness in the direction
indicated by the doctor. Presently
Bill, who was in the lead, held up
his hand with a warning gesture. The
other three closed up as rapidly as
cautious progress would allow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Bill?&#8221; asked the doctor
in an undertone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slip up ahead and look over that
crest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor obeyed instructions. As
he glanced over he gave vent to a low
whistle of surprise and motioned for
Carnes to join him. The operative
crawled up and glanced over the crest.
In a hollow before them was a crude
one-storied house, and erected on an
open space before it was a massive
piece of apparatus. It consisted of a
number of huge metallic cylinders,
from which lines ran to a silvery concave
mirror mounted on an elaborate
frame which would allow it to be rotated
so as to point in any direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; whispered Carnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some kind of a projector,&#8221; muttered
the doctor. &#8220;I never saw one quite like
it, but it is meant to project something.
I can&#8217;t make out the curve of that mirror.
It isn&#8217;t a parabola and it isn&#8217;t an
ellipse. It must be a high degree subcatenary
or else built on a transcendental
function.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised himself to get a clearer
view, and as he did so a puff of smoke
came from the house, to be followed in
a moment by a sharp crack as a bullet
flattened itself a few inches from his
head. The doctor tumbled back over
the crest out of sight of the house. Bill
and Walter hurried forward, their
rifles held ready for action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out on the flanks, men,&#8221; directed
the doctor. &#8220;The man we want is in a
house in that hollow. He&#8217;s armed, and
he means business.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Bill</span> and Walter crawled under
the shelter of the rocks to a short
distance away and then, rifles ready,
advanced to the attack. A report came
from the hollow and a bullet whined
over Bill&#8217;s head. Almost instantly a
crack came from Walter&#8217;s rifle and
splinters flew from the building in the
hollow a few inches from a loophole,
through which projected the barrel of
a rifle.</p>
<p>The rifle barrel swung rapidly in a
circle and barked in Walter&#8217;s direction;
but as it did so, Bill&#8217;s gun spoke
and again splinters flew from the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work!&#8221; ejaculated Dr. Bird as
he watched the slow advance of the two
guides. &#8220;If we just had rifles we could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
join in the party, but it&#8217;s a little far for
effective pistol work. Let&#8217;s go ahead,
and we may get close enough to do a
little shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pistols in hand, Carnes and the
doctor crawled over the crest and
joined the advance. Again and again
the rifle spoke from the hollow and was
answered by the vicious barks of the
rifles in the hands of the guides, Carnes
and the doctor resting their pistols on
rocks and sending an occasional bullet
toward the loophole. The conditions of
light and the moving target were not
conducive to good marksmanship on
the part of the besieged man, and none
of the attackers were hit. Presently
Walter succeeded in sending a bullet
through the loophole. The rifle barrel
suddenly disappeared. With a shout
the four men rose from their cover and
advanced toward the building at a run.</p>
<p>As they did so an ominous whirring
sound came from the apparatus in front
of the house and a sudden chill filled
the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back!&#8221; shouted Dr. Bird. &#8220;Back
below the hill if you value your lives!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and raced at full speed
toward the sheltering crest of the hill,
the others following him closely. The
whirring sound continued, and the concave
reflector turned with a grating
sound on its gears. As the path of its
rays struck the ground the rocks became
white with frost and one rock
split with a sharp report, one fragment
rolling down the slope, carrying others
in its trail.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">With</span> panic-stricken faces the
four men raced toward the sheltering
crest, but remorselessly the reflector
swung around in their direction.
The intense cold numbed the racing
men, cutting off their breath and impeding
their efforts for speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried the doctor suddenly.
&#8220;Fire at that reflector! It&#8217;s our only
chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>He set the example by turning and
emptying his pistol futilely at the
turning mirror. Bill, Walter and Carnes
followed his example. Nearer and
nearer to them came the deadly ray.
Bill was the nearest to its path, and he
suddenly stiffened and fell forward,
his useless gun still grasped in his
hands. As his body struck the ground
it rolled down hill for a few feet, the
deadly ray following it. His head
struck a rock, and Carnes gave a cry of
horror as it broke into fragments.</p>
<p>Walter threw his rifle to his shoulder
and fired again and again at the rotating
disc. The cold had became intense
and he could not control the actions of
his muscles and his rifle wavered about.
He threw himself flat on the ground,
and, with an almost superhuman effort,
steadied himself for a moment and
fired. His aim was true, and with a
terrific crash the reflector split into a
thousand fragments. Dr. Bird staggered
to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of order for a moment!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;To the house while we can!&#8221;</p>
<p>As swiftly as his numbed feet would
allow him, he stumbled toward the
house. The muzzle of the rifle again
projected from the loophole and with
its crack the doctor staggered for a
moment and then fell. Walter&#8217;s rifle
spoke again and the rifle disappeared
through the loophole with a spasmodic
jerk. Carnes stumbled over the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hit badly?&#8221; he gasped
through chattering teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hit at all,&#8221; muttered the
doctor. &#8220;I stumbled and fell just as he
fired. Look out! He&#8217;s going to shoot
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The rifle barrel came slowly into
view through the loophole. Walter
fired, but his bullet went wild. Carnes
threw himself behind a rock for protection.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> rifle swung in Walter&#8217;s direction
and paused. As it did so, from
the house came a strangled cry and a
sound as of a blow. The rifle barrel
disappeared, and the sounds of a struggle
came from the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried Carnes as he rose
to his feet, and made his stumbling way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
forward, the others following at the
best speed which their numbed limbs
would allow.</p>
<p>As they reached the door they were
aware of a struggle which was going on
inside. With an oath the doctor threw
his massive frame against the door. It
creaked, but the solid oak of which it
was composed was proof against the attack,
and he drew back for another onslaught.
From the house came a pistol
shot, followed by a despairing cry and
a guttural shout. Reinforced by Carnes,
the doctor threw his weight against the
door again. With a rending crash it
gave, and they fell sprawling into the
cabin. The doctor was the first one on
his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked a voice from
one corner. The doctor whirled like a
flash and covered the speaker with his
pistol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put them up!&#8221; he said tersely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am unarmed,&#8221; the voice replied.
&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re from the United States Secret
Service,&#8221; replied Carnes who had
gained his feet. &#8220;The game is up for
you, and you&#8217;d better realize it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Secret Service! Thank God!&#8221; cried
the voice. &#8220;Get Koskoff&ndash;&ndash;he has the
plans. He has gone out through the
tunnel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; demanded Carnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The entrance is that iron plate on
the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carnes and the doctor jumped at the
plate and tried to lift it, without result.
There was no handle or projection on
which they could take hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that way,&#8221; cried the voice.
&#8220;That cover is fastened on the inside.
Go outside the building; he&#8217;ll come
out about two hundred yards north.
Shoot him as he appears or he&#8217;ll get
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three men nearly tumbled over
each other to get through the doorway
into the bitter cold outside. As they
emerged from the cabin the gaze of the
guide swept the surrounding hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get him!&#8221; said Carnes sharply.</p>
<p>Walter ran forward a few feet and
dropped prone on the ground, cuddling
the stock of his rifle to his cheek. Two
hundred yards ahead a figure was
scurrying over the rocks away from the
cabin. Walter drew in his breath and
his hand suddenly grew steady as his
keen gray eyes peered through the
sights. Carnes and the doctor held
their breath in sympathy.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Suddenly</span> the rifle spoke, and the
fleeing man threw up his arms and
fell forward on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got him,&#8221; said Walter laconically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go bring the body in, Carnes,&#8221; exclaimed
the doctor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of
the chap inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get him?&#8221; asked the voice
eagerly, as the doctor stepped inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead all right,&#8221; replied the
doctor grimly. &#8220;Who the devil are you,
and what are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a light switch on the left
of the door as you come in,&#8221; was the
reply.</p>
<p>Dr. Bird found the switch and
snapped on a light. He turned toward
the corner from whence the voice had
come and recoiled in horror. Propped
in the corner was the body of a middle-aged
man, daubed and splashed with
blood which ran from a wound in the
side of his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;Let
me help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much use,&#8221; replied the
man rather faintly. &#8220;I am about done
in. This face wound doesn&#8217;t amount to
much, but I am shot through the body
and am bleeding internally. If you try
to move me, it may easily kill me. Leave
me alone until your partners come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor drew a flask of brandy
from his pocket and advanced toward
the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a few drops of this,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>With an effort the man lifted the
flask to his lips and gulped down a little
of the fiery spirit. A sound of
tramping feet came from the outside
and then a thud as though a body had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
been dropped. Carnes and Walter entered
the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead as a mackerel,&#8221; said
Carnes in answer to the doctor&#8217;s look.
&#8220;Walter got him through the neck and
broke his spinal cord. He never knew
what hit him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The plans?&#8221; came in a gasping voice
from the man in the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got them, too,&#8221; replied Carnes.
&#8220;He had both packets inside his coat.
They have been opened, but I guess
they are all here. Who the devil are
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Koskoff is dead, and I am dying,
there is no reason why I shouldn&#8217;t
tell you,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Leave that
brandy handy to keep up my strength.
I have only a short time and I can&#8217;t repeat.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">A</span><span class="dcap">s to</span> who I am or what I was, it
doesn&#8217;t really matter. Koskoff
knew me as John Smith, and it will
pass as well as any other name. Let my
past stay buried. I am, or was, a scientist
of some ability; but fortune
frowned on me, and I was driven out of
the world. Money would rehabilitate
me&ndash;&ndash;money will do anything nowadays&ndash;&ndash;so
I set out to get it. In the course
of my experimental work, I had discovered
that cold was negative heat and
reacted to the laws which governed
heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that,&#8221; cried Dr. Bird; &#8220;but
I never could prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded John
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Bird, of the Bureau of Standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bird. I&#8217;ve heard of you. You
can understand me when I say that as
heat, positive heat is a concomitant of
ordinary light. I have found that cold,
negative heat, is a concomitant of cold
light. Is my apparatus in good shape
outside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reflector is smashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. You would have enjoyed
studying it. I presume that you saw
that it was a catenary curve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather thought so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was, and it was also adjustable. I
could vary the focal point from a few
feet to several miles. With that apparatus
I could throw a beam of negative
heat with a focal point which I
could adjust at will. Close to the apparatus,
I could obtain a temperature
almost down to absolute zero, but at the
longer ranges it wasn&#8217;t so cold, due to
leakage into the atmosphere. Even at
two miles I could produce a local temperature
of three hundred degrees below
zero.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the source of your cold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liquid helium. Those cylinders
contain, or rather did contain, for I expect
that Koskoff has emptied them,
helium in a liquid state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your compressor?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">I</span><span class="dcap"> didn&#8217;t</span> have to use one. I developed
a cold light under whose
rays helium would liquefy and remain
in a state of equilibrium until exposed
to light rays. Those cylinders had
merely enough pressure to force the
liquid out to where the sun could hit
it, and then it turned to a gas, dropping
the temperature at the first focal point
of the reflector to absolute zero. When
I had this much done, Koskoff and I
packed the whole apparatus here and
were ready for work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were on the path of the transcontinental
air mail, and I bided my
time until an especially valuable shipment
was to be made. My plans, which
worked perfectly, were to freeze the
plane in midair and then rob the wreck.
I heard of the jewel shipment the
T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C. was to carry and I planned to
get it. When the plane came over,
Koskoff and I brought it down. The
unsuspected presence of another plane
upset us a little, and I started to bring
it down. But we had been all over this
country and knew there was no place
that a plane could land. I let it go on in
safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Carnes with a
grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We robbed the wreck and we found
two packets, one the jewels I was after,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
and the other a sealed packet, which
proved to contain certain War Department
plans. That was when I learned
who Koskoff was. I had hired him in
San Francisco as a good mechanic who
had no principles. He was to get one-fourth
of the loot. When we found
these plans, he told me who he was. He
was really a Russian secret agent and
he wanted to deliver the plans to Russia.
I may be a thief and a murderer,
but I am not yet ready to betray my
country, and I told him so. He offered
me almost any price for the plans; but
I wouldn&#8217;t listen. We had a serious
quarrel, and he overpowered me and
bound me.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">e</span> had a radio set here and he
called San Francisco and sent
some code message. I think he was
waiting here for someone to come.
Had we followed our original plans,
we would have been miles from here
before you arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had me bound and helpless, as
he thought, but I worked my bonds a
little loose. I didn&#8217;t let him know it,
for I knew that the plane I had let
get away would guide a party here and
I thought I might be able to help out.
When you came and attacked the
house, I worked at my bonds until they
were loose enough to throw off. I saw
Koskoff start my cold apparatus to
working and then he quit, because he
ran out of helium. When he started
shooting again, I worked out of my
bonds and tackled him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a better man than I gave
him credit for, or else he suspected me,
for about the time I grabbed him he
whirled and struck me over the head
with his gun barrel and tore my face
open. The blow stunned me, and when
I came to, I was thrown into this corner.
I meant to have another try at it,
but I guess you rushed him too fast.
He turned and ran for the tunnel, but
as he did so, he shot me through the
body. I guess I didn&#8217;t look dead enough
to suit him. You gentlemen broke open
the door and came in. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by a long shot, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed
Dr. Bird. &#8220;Where is that cold
light apparatus of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you get into it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will open that cupboard on
the wall, you&#8217;ll find an open knife
switch on the wall. Close it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dr. Bird</span> found the switch and
closed it. As he did so the cabin
rocked on its foundations and both
Carnes and Walter were thrown to the
ground. The thud of a detonation deep
in the earth came to their ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; cried the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied Smith with a wan
smile, &#8220;was the detonation of two hundred
pounds of T.N.T. When you dig
down into the underground cave where
we used the cold light apparatus, you
will find it in fragments. It was my
only child, and I&#8217;ll take it with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he finished his head slumped forward
on his chest. With an exclamation
of dismay Dr. Bird sprang forward and
tried to lift the prostrate form.</p>
<p>In an agony of desire the Doctor
tightened his grip on the dying man&#8217;s
shoulder. But Smith collapsed into
a heap. Dr. Bird bent forward and
tore open his shirt and listened at his
chest. Presently he straightened up.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is gone,&#8221; he said sadly, &#8220;and I
guess the results of his genius have
died with him. He doesn&#8217;t strike me
as a man who left overmuch to chance.
Carnes, is your case completed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very satisfactorily, Doctor. I have
both of the lost packets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, come back to the
wreck and help me pack my burros. I
can make my way back to Fallon without
a guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, Carnes, old dear, is none of
your blankety blanked business. Permit
me to remind you that I am on my
vacation. I haven&#8217;t decided yet just
where I am going, but I can tell you
one thing. It&#8217;s going to be some place
where you can&#8217;t call me on the telephone.&#8221;</p>

<h3><i>Foreword by Ray Cummings</i></h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I have</span> been thinking that if, during
one of those long winter evenings
at Valley Forge, someone had
placed in
George Washington&#8217;s
hands one
of our present
day best sellers,
the illustrious Father of our Country
would have read it with considerable
emotion. I do not mean what we
call a story of science, or fantasy&ndash;&ndash;just
a novel of
action, adventure
and romance. The
sort of thing you
and I like to read,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
but do not find amazing in any way at
all.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>Black mutiny and brigandage stalk the
Space-ship Planetara as she speeds to the
Moon to pick up a fabulously rich cache
of radium-ore.</p>
<p>But I fancy that George Washington
would have found it amazing. Don&#8217;t
you? It might picture, for instance, a
factory girl at a sewing machine.
George Washington would be amazed
at a sewing machine. And the girl,
journeying in the subway to and from
her work! Stealing an opportunity to
telephone her lover at the noon hour;
going to the movies in the evening, or
listening to a radio. And there might
be a climax, perhaps, with the girl and
the villain in a transcontinental railway
Pullman, and the hero sending
frantic telegrams, or telephoning the
train, and then chasing it in his airplane.</p>
<p>George Washington would have
found it amazing!</p>
<p>And I am wondering how you and I
would feel if someone were to give us
now a book of ordinary adventure of
the sort which will be published a hundred
and fifty years hence. I have been
trying to imagine such a book and the
nature of its contents.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Let</span> us imagine it together. Suppose
we walk down Fifth Avenue,
a pleasant spring morning of May,
2080. Fifth Avenue, no doubt, will be
there. I don&#8217;t know whether the New
York Public Library will be there or
not. We&#8217;ll assume that it is, and that
it has some sort of books, printed, or in
whatever fashion you care to imagine.</p>
<p>The young man library attendant is
surprised at our curiously antiquated
aspect. We look as though we were
dressed for some historical costume
ball. We talk old-fashioned English,
like actors in an historical play of the
1930 period.</p>
<p>But we get the book. The attendant
assures us it is a good average story
of action and adventure. Nothing remarkable,
but he read it himself, and
found it interesting.</p>
<p>We thank him and take the book.
But we find that the language in which
it is written is too strange for comfortable
reading. And it names so many
extraordinary things so casually! As
though we knew all about them, which
we certainly do not!</p>
<p>So we take it to the kind-hearted
librarian in the language division. He
modifies it to old-fashioned English of
1930, and he puts occasional footnotes
to help explain some of the things we
might not understand. Why he should
bother to do this for us I don&#8217;t know;
but let us assume that he does.</p>
<p>And now we take the book home&ndash;&ndash;in
the pneumatic tube, or aerial moving
sidewalk, or airship, or whatever it is
we take to get home.</p>
<p>And now that we are home, let&#8217;s read
the book. It ought to be interesting.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
</div>
<p class='chintro'><i>Tells of the Grantline Moon Expedition
and of the Mysterious Martian Who
Followed Us in the City Corridor</i></p>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">One</span> may write about oneself
and still not be an egoist. Or
so, at least, they tell me. My
narrative went broadcast with
a fair success. It was pantomimed and
the public flashed me a reasonable approval.
And so my disc publishers have
suggested that I record it in more permanent
form.</p>
<p>I introduce myself, begging grace
that I intrude upon your busy minutes,
with my only excuse that perhaps I
may amuse you. For what the commercial
sellers of my pictured version
were pleased to blare as my handsome
face, I ask your indulgence. My feminine
audience of the pantomimes was
undoubtedly graciously pleased at my
personality and physical aspect. That
I am &#8220;tall as a Viking of old&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and
&#8220;handsome as a young Norse God&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;is
very pretty talk in the selling of my
product. But I deplore its intrusion
into the personality of this, my recorded
narrative. And so now, for preface,
to all my audience I do give
earnest assurance that Gregg Haljan is
no conceited zebra, handsomely striped
by nature, and proud of it. Not so. I
am, I do beg you to believe, a very
humble fellow, striving for your approval,
hoping only to entertain you.</p>
<p>My introduction: My name, Gregg
Haljan. My age, twenty-five years. I
was, at the time my narrative begins,
Third Officer on the Space-Ship Planetara.
Our line was newly established;
in 2070, to be exact, following the
modern improvements of the Martel
Magnetic Levitation.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Our</span> ship, whose home port was
Great-New York, carried mail and
passenger traffic to and from both
Venus and Mars. Of astronomical necessity,
our flights were irregular. This
spring, with the two other planets both
close to the earth, we were making two
complete round trips. We had just arrived
in Great-New York, this May
evening, from Grebhar, Venus Free
State. With only five hours in port
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
here, we were departing the same night
at the zero hour for Ferrok-Shahn,
capital of the Martian Union.</p>
<p>We were no sooner at the landing
stage than I found a code-flash summoning
Dan Dean and me to Divisional
Detective Headquarters. Dan &#8220;Snap&#8221;
Dean was one of my closest friends.
He was radio-helio operator of the
Planetara. A small, wiry, red-headed
chap, with a quick, ready laugh and a
wit that made everyone like him.</p>
<p>The summons to Detective-Colonel
Halsey&#8217;s office surprised us. Snap eyed
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been opening any treasury
vaults, have you, Gregg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants you, also,&#8221; I retorted.</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;Well, he can roar at
me like a traffic switchman and my
private life will remain my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>We could not think why we should
be wanted. It was the darkness of mid-evening
when we left the Planetara for
Halsey&#8217;s office. It was not a long trip.
We went direct in the upper monorail,
descending into the subterranean city
at Park-Circle 30.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We had</span> never been to Halsey&#8217;s
office before. We found it to be
a gloomy, vaultlike place in one of the
deepest corridors. The door lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg Haljan and Daniel Dean.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guard stood aside. &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>I own that my heart was unduly
thumping as we entered. The door
dropped behind us. It was a small blue-lit
apartment&ndash;&ndash;a steel-lined room like a
vault.</p>
<p>Colonel Halsey sat at his desk. And
the big, heavy-set, florid Captain Carter&ndash;&ndash;our
commander of the Planetara&ndash;&ndash;was
here. That surprised us: we had
not seen him leave the ship.</p>
<p>Halsey smiled at us gravely. Captain
Carter said, &#8220;Sit down, lads.&#8221;</p>
<p>We took the seats. There was an
alarming solemnity about this. If I had
been guilty of anything that I could
think of, it would have been frightening.
But Halsey&#8217;s first words reassured
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the Grantline Moon Expedition.
In spite of our secrecy, the
news has gotten out. We want to know
how. Can you tell us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Carter&#8217;s huge bulk&ndash;&ndash;he was
about as tall as I am&ndash;&ndash;towered over us
as we sat before Halsey&#8217;s desk. &#8220;If you
lads have told anyone&ndash;&ndash;said anything&ndash;&ndash;let
slip the slightest hint about
it&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap smiled with relief; but he
turned solemn at once. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t. Not
a word!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor have I,&#8221; I declared.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> Grantline Moon Expedition!
We had not thought of that as a
reason for this summons. Johnny
Grantline was a close friend to us both.
He had organized an exploring expedition
to the Moon. Uninhabited, with
its bleak, forbidding, airless, waterless
surface, the Moon&ndash;&ndash;even though so
close to the Earth&ndash;&ndash;was seldom visited.
No regular ship ever stopped there. A
few exploring parties of recent years
had come to grief.</p>
<p>But there was a persistent rumor
that upon the Moon, mineral riches of
fabulous wealth were awaiting discovery.
The thing had already caused
some interplanetary complications. The
aggressive Martians would be only too
glad to explore the Moon. But the
U.S.W.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> definitely warned them away.
The Moon was World Territory, we
announced, and we would protect it
as such.</p>
<p>The threatened conflict between the
Earth and Mars had come to nothing.
There was, this year of 2079, a thorough
amity between all three of the inhabited
planets. It still holds, and I pray that
it may always hold.</p>
<p>There was, nevertheless, a realization
by our government, that whatever riches
might be upon the Moon should be
seized at once and held by some reputable
Earth Company. And when Johnny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
Grantline applied, with his father&#8217;s
wealth and his own scientific record
of attainment, the government was only
too glad to grant him its writ.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> Grantline Expedition had
started six months ago. The Martian
government had acquiesced in our
ultimatum, yet brigands have been
known to be financed under cover of
a governmental disavowal. And so the
expedition was kept secret.</p>
<p>My words need give no offense to
any Martian who comes upon them. I
refer to the history of our earth only.
The Grantline Expedition was on the
Moon now. No word had come from it.
One could not flash helios even in code
without letting all the universe know
that explorers were on the Moon. And
why they were there, anyone could
easily guess.</p>
<p>And now Colonel Halsey was telling
us that the news was abroad! Captain
Carter eyed us closely; his flashing
eyes under the white bushy brows
would pry a secret from anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure? A girl of Venus, perhaps,
with her cursed, seductive lure!
A chance word, with you lads befuddled
by alcolite?&#8221;</p>
<p>We assured him we had been careful.
By the heavens, I know that I had
been. Not a whisper, even to Snap, of
the name Grantline in six months or
more.</p>
<p>Captain Carter added abruptly,
&#8220;We&#8217;re insulated here, Halsey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, talk as freely as you like. An
eavesdropping ray will never get into
these walls.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">They</span> questioned us. They were
satisfied at last that, though the
secret had escaped, we had not done it.
Hearing it discussed, it occurred to me
to wonder why Carter was concerned.
I was not aware that he knew of Grantline&#8217;s
venture. I learned now the reason
why the Planetara, upon each of her
voyages, had managed to pass fairly
close to the Moon. It had been arranged
with Grantline that if he
wanted help or had any important message,
he was to flash it locally to our
passing ship. And this Snap knew, and
had never mentioned it, even to me.</p>
<p>Halsey was saying, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t
blame you, but the secret is out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap and I regarded each other.
What could anyone do? What would
anyone dare do?</p>
<p>Captain Carter said abruptly, &#8220;Look
here, lads, this is my chance now to
talk plainly to you. Outside, anywhere
outside these walls, an eavesdropping
ray may be upon us. You know that?
One may never even dare whisper since
that accursed ray was developed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap opened his mouth to speak but
decided against it. My heart was
pounding.</p>
<p>Captain Carter went on, &#8220;I know I
can trust you two more than anyone
else under me on the Planetara&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; I demanded.
&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He interrupted me. &#8220;Nothing at all
but what I say.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Halsey</span> smiled grimly. &#8220;What he
means, Haljan, is that things are
not always what they seem these days.
One cannot always tell a friend from
an enemy. The Planetara is a public
vessel. You have&ndash;&ndash;how many is it, Carter?&ndash;&ndash;thirty
or forty passengers this
trip to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-eight,&#8221; said Carter.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are thirty-eight people listed
for the flight to Ferrok-Shahn to-night,&#8221;
Halsey said slowly. &#8220;And some
may not be what they seem.&#8221; He raised
his thin dark hand. &#8220;We have information&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
He paused. &#8220;I confess, we know
almost nothing&ndash;&ndash;hardly more than
enough to alarm us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Carter interjected, &#8220;I want
you and Dean to be on your guard.
Once on the Planetara it is difficult
for us to talk openly, but be watchful.
I will arrange for us to be doubly
armed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vague, perturbing words! Halsey
said, &#8220;They tell me George Prince is
listed for the voyage. I am suggesting,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
Haljan, that you keep your eye especially
upon him. Your duties on the
Planetara leave you comparatively free,
don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I agreed. With the first and
second officers on duty, and the captain
aboard, my routine was more or
less that of an understudy.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;George Prince! Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mechanical engineer,&#8221; said Halsey.
&#8220;An under-official of the Earth
Federated Radium Corporation. But he
associates with bad companions&ndash;&ndash;particularly
Martians.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had never heard of this George
Prince, though I was familiar with the
Federated Radium Corporation, of
course. A semi-government trust, which
controlled virtually the entire Earth
supply of radium.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in the Automotive Department,&#8221;
Carter put in. &#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of
the Federated Radium Motor?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> had, of course. A recent Earth
invention which promised to
revolutionize the automotive industry.
An engine of a new type, using radium
as its fuel.</p>
<p>Snap demanded, &#8220;What in the stars
has this got to do with Johnny Grantline?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much,&#8221; said Halsey quietly, &#8220;or perhaps
nothing. But George Prince some
years ago mixed in rather unethical
transactions. We had him in custody
once. He is known now as unusually
friendly with several Martians in New
York of bad reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Snap.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Halsey went
on quietly, &#8220;is that Grantline expects
to find radium on the Moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>We gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Halsey. &#8220;The ill-fated
Ballon Expedition thought they had
found it on the Moon some years ago.
A new type of ore, as rich in radium
as our gold-bearing sands are rich in
gold. Ballon&#8217;s first samples gave uranium
atoms with a fair representation of
ionium and thorium. A richly radio-active
ore. A lode of the pure radium
is there somewhere, without doubt.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> added vehemently, &#8220;Do you understand
now why we should be
suspicious of this George Prince? He
has a criminal record. He has a
thorough technical knowledge of radium
ores. He associates with Martians
of bad reputation. A large Martian
Company has recently developed a radium
engine to compete with our Earth
motor. You know that? You know that
there is very little radium available on
Mars, and our government will not allow
our own radium supply to be exported.
That Martian Company needs
radium. It will do anything to get
radium. What do you suppose it would
pay for a few tons of really rich radio-active
ore&ndash;&ndash;such as Grantline may have
found on the Moon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I objected, &#8220;that is a reputable
Martian company. It&#8217;s backed by the
government of the Martian Union. The
government of Mars would not dare&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; Captain Carter exclaimed
sardonically. &#8220;Not openly! But
if Martian brigands had a supply of
radium&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t imagine where it came
from would make much difference.
That Martian Company would buy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halsey added, &#8220;And George Prince,
my agents inform me, seems to know
that Grantline is on the Moon. Put it
all together, lads. Little sparks show
the hidden current.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than that: George Prince
knows that we have arranged to have
the Planetara stop at the Moon and
bring back Grantline&#8217;s radium-ore. This
is your last voyage this year. You&#8217;ll
hear from Grantline this time, we&#8217;re
convinced. He&#8217;ll probably give you the
signal as you pass the Moon on your
way out. Coming back, you&#8217;ll stop at
the Moon and transport whatever radium-ore
Grantline has ready. The Grantline
Flyer is too small for ore transportation.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Halsey&#8217;s</span> voice turned grimly
sarcastic. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it seem queer
that George Prince and a few of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
Martian friends happen to be listed as
passengers for this voyage?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, Snap
and I regarded each other. Halsey
added abruptly,</p>
<p>&#8220;We had George Prince typed that
time we arrested him four years ago.
I&#8217;ll show him to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He snapped open an alcove, and said
to his waiting attendant, &#8220;Get me the
type of George Prince.&#8221;</p>
<p>The disc in a moment came through
the pneumatic. Halsey, smiling wryly,
adjusted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice looking fellow. Nicely
spoken. Though at the time we made
this he was somewhat annoyed, naturally.
He is older now. Twenty-nine, to
be exact. Here he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The image glowed on the grids before
us. His name, George Prince, in
letters illumined upon his forehead,
showed for a moment and then faded.
He stood smiling sourly before us as
he repeated the official formula:</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is George Prince. I was
born in Great-New York City twenty-five
years ago.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I gazed</span> at this life-size, moving
image of George Prince. He stood
somber in the black detention uniform.
A dark, almost a girlishly handsome
fellow, well below medium height&ndash;&ndash;the
rod beside him showed five feet four
inches. Slim and slight. Long, wavy
black hair, falling about his ears. A
pale, clean-cut, really handsome face,
almost beardless. I regarded it closely.
A face that would have been femininely
beautiful without its masculine
touch of heavy black brows and firmly
set jaw. His voice as he spoke was low
and soft; but at the end, with the concluding
words, &#8220;I am innocent!&#8221; it
flashed into strong masculinity. His
eyes, shaded with long, girlish black
lashes, by chance met mine. &#8220;I am innocent.&#8221;
His curving sensuous lips
drew down into a grim sneer....</p>
<p>The type faded at its end. Halsey
replaced the disc in its box and waved
the attendant away. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned back to Snap and me.
&#8220;Well, there he is. We have nothing
tangible against him now. But I&#8217;ll say
this: he&#8217;s a clever fellow, one to be
afraid of. I would not blare it from the
newscasters&#8217; microphone, but if he is
hatching any plot, he has been too
clever for my agents.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked for another half-hour, and
then Captain Carter dismissed us. We
left Halsey&#8217;s office with Carter&#8217;s final
words ringing in our ears. &#8220;Whatever
comes, lads, remember I trust you....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Snap</span> and I decided to walk a portion
of the way back to the ship.
It was barely more than a mile through
this subterranean corridor to where we
could get the vertical lift direct to the
landing stage.</p>
<p>We started off on the lower level.
Once outside the insulation of Halsey&#8217;s
office we did not dare talk of this
thing. Not only electrical ears, but
every possible eavesdropping device
might be upon us. The corridor was two
hundred feet or more below the ground
level. At this hour of the night this
business section was comparatively deserted.
The through tube sounded over
our heads with the passing of its occasional
trains. The ventilators buzzed
and whirred. At the cross intersections,
the traffic directors dozed at their posts.
It was hot and sticky down here, and
gloomy with the daylight globes extinguished,
and only the night lights
to give a dim illumination. The stores
and office arcades were all closed and
deserted; only an occasional night-light
burning behind their windows.</p>
<p>Our footfalls echoed on the metal
grids as we hurried along.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice evening,&#8221; said Snap awkwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt oppressed. As though prying
eyes and ears were here. We walked
for a time in silence, each of us busy
with memory of what had transpired
in Halsey&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Suddenly Snap gripped me. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I whispered.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> stopped at a corner. An entryway
was here. Snap pulled
me into it. I could feel him quivering
with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I demanded in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re being followed. Did you hear
anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Yet I thought now I could
hear something. Vague footfalls. A
rustling. And a microscopic electrical
whine, as though some device were
near us.</p>
<p>Snap was fumbling in his pocket.
&#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ve got a pair of low-scale
phones.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put the little grids against his
ears. I could hear the sharp intake of
his breath. Then he seized me, pulled
me down to the metal floor of the entryway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back, Gregg! Get back!&#8221; I could
barely hear his whisper. We crouched
as far back into the doorway as we
could get. I was armed. My official permit
for the carrying of the pencil heat-ray
allowed me to have it always with
me. I drew it now. But there was
nothing to shoot at. I felt Snap clamping
the grids on my ears. And now I
heard something! An intensification of
the vague footsteps I had thought I
heard before.</p>
<p>There was something following us!
Something out in the corridor there
now! A street light was nearby. The
corridor was dim, but plainly visible;
and to my sight it was empty. But
there was something there. Something
invisible! I could hear it moving.
Creeping towards us. I pulled the
grids off my ears.</p>
<p>Snap murmured, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a local
phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! I&#8217;ll get them to give us the
street glare!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I pressed</span> the danger signal, giving
our location to the nearest operator.
In a second or two we got the
light. The street in all this neighborhood
burst into a brilliant actinic
glare. The thing menacing us was revealed!
A figure in a black cloak,
crouching thirty feet away across the
corridor.</p>
<p>Snap was on his feet. His voice rang
shrilly, &#8220;There it is! Give it a shot,
Gregg!&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap was unarmed, but he flung his
hands out menacingly. The figure,
which may perhaps not have been aware
of our city safeguard, was taken wholly
by surprise. A human figure. Seven
feet tall, at the least, and therefore, I
judged, doubtless a Martian man. The
black cloak covered his head. He took
a step toward us, hesitated, and then
turned in confusion.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s shrill voice was bringing help.
The whine of a street guard&#8217;s alarm
whistle nearby sounded. The figure was
making off! My pencil-ray was in my
hand and I pressed its switch. The tiny
heat-ray stabbed through the glare, but
I missed. The figure stumbled, but did
not fall. I saw a bare gray arm come
from the cloak, flung up to maintain
its balance. Or perhaps my pencil-ray
of heat had seared the arm. The gray-skinned
arm of a Martian.</p>
<p>Snap was shouting, &#8220;Give him another!&#8221;
But the figure passed beyond
the actinic glare and vanished.</p>
<p>We were detained in the turmoil of
the corridor for ten minutes or more
with official explanations. Then a message
from Halsey released us. The Martian
who had been following us in his
invisible cloak was never caught.</p>
<p>We escaped from the crowd at last
and made our way back to the Planetara,
where the passengers were already
assembling for the outward Martian
voyage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<h4>&#8220;<i>A Fleeting Glance</i>&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I stood</span> on the turret-balcony of
the Planetara with Captain Carter
and Dr. Frank, the ship surgeon, watching
the arriving passengers. It was
close to the zero hour: the level of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
stage was a turmoil of confusion. The
escalators, with the last of the freight
aboard, were folded back. But the
stage was jammed with the incoming
passenger baggage: the interplanetary
customs and tax officials with their
X-ray and Zed-ray paraphernalia and
the passengers themselves, lined up for
the export inspection.</p>
<p>At this height, the city lights lay
spread in a glare of blue and yellow beneath
us. The individual local planes
came dropping like birds to our stage.
Thirty-eight passengers for this flight
to Mars, but that accursed desire of
every friend and relative to speed the
departing voyager brought a hundred
or more extra people to crowd our
girders and bring added difficulty to
everybody.</p>
<p>Carter was too absorbed in his duties
to stay with us long. But here in the
turret Dr. Frank and I found ourselves
at the moment with nothing much to do
but watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think we&#8217;ll get away on time,
Gregg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said. &#8220;And this of all voyages&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I checked myself, with thumping
heart. My thoughts were so full of
what Halsey and Carter had told us
that it was difficult to rein my tongue.
Yet here in the turret, unguarded by
insulation, I could say nothing. Nor
would I have dared mention the Grantline
Moon Expedition to Dr. Frank. I
wondered what he knew of this affair.
Perhaps as much as I&ndash;&ndash;perhaps nothing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> was a thin, dark, rather smallish
man of fifty, this ship&#8217;s surgeon,
trim in his blue and white uniform. I
knew him well: we had made several
flights together. An American&ndash;&ndash;I
fancy of Jewish ancestry. A likable
man, and a skillful doctor and surgeon.
He and I had always been good friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crowded,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Johnson says
thirty-eight. I hope they&#8217;re experienced
travelers. This pressure sickness is a
rotten nuisance&ndash;&ndash;keeps me dashing
around all night assuring frightened
women they&#8217;re not going to die. Last
voyage, coming out of the Venus atmosphere&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He plunged into a lugubrious account
of his troubles with space-sick
voyagers. But I was in no mood to
listen. My gaze was down on the
spider incline, up which, over the bend
of the ship&#8217;s sleek, silvery body, the
passengers and their friends were coming
in little groups. The upper deck
was already jammed with them.</p>
<p>The Planetara, as flyers go, was not
a large vessel. Cylindrical of body,
forty feet maximum beam, and two
hundred and seventy-five feet in overall
length. The passenger superstructure&ndash;&ndash;no
more than a hundred feet long&ndash;&ndash;was
set amidships. A narrow deck,
metallic-enclosed, and with large bulls-eye
windows, encircled the superstructure.
Some of the cabins opened directly
onto the deck. Others had doors
to the interior corridors. There were
half a dozen small but luxurious public
rooms.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> rest of the vessel was given to
freight storage and the mechanism
and control compartments. Forward of
the passenger structure the deck level
continued under the cylindrical dome-roof
to the bow. The forward watch-tower
observatory was here; officers&#8217;
cabins; Captain Carter&#8217;s navigating
rooms and Dr. Frank&#8217;s office. Similarly,
under the stern-dome, was the stern
watch-tower and a series of power compartments.</p>
<p>Above the superstructure a confusion
of spider bridges, ladders and
balconies were laced like a metal network.
The turret in which Dr. Frank
and I now stood was perched here.
Fifty feet away, like a bird&#8217;s nest,
Snap&#8217;s instrument room stood clinging
to the metal bridge. The dome-roof,
with the glassite windows rolled back
now, rose in a mound-peak to cover this
highest middle portion of the vessel.</p>
<p>Below, in the main hull, blue-lit
metal corridors ran the entire length
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
of the ship. Freight storage compartments;
gravity control rooms; the air
renewal systems; heater and ventilators
and pressure mechanisms&ndash;&ndash;all were located
there. And the kitchens, stewards&#8217;
compartments, and the living quarters
of the crew. We carried a crew of sixteen,
this voyage, exclusive of the navigating
officers, and the purser, Snap
Dean, and Dr. Frank.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> passengers coming aboard
seemed a fair representation of
what we usually had for the outward
voyage to Ferrok-Shahn. Most were
Earth people&ndash;&ndash;and returning Martians.
Dr. Frank pointed out one. A huge
Martian in a gray cloak. A seven-foot
fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Set Miko,&#8221; Dr. Frank
remarked. &#8220;Ever heard of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The doctor suddenly
checked himself, as though he were
sorry he had spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of him,&#8221; I repeated
slowly.</p>
<p>An awkward silence fell suddenly
between us.</p>
<p>There were a few Venus passengers.
I saw one of them presently coming up
the incline, and recognized her. A girl
traveling alone. We had brought her
from Grebhar, last voyage but one. I
remembered her. An alluring sort of
girl, as most of them are. Her name
was Venza. She spoke English well.
A singer and dancer who had been imported
to Great-New York to fill some
theatrical engagement. She&#8217;d made
quite a hit on the Great White Way.</p>
<p>She came up the incline, with the
carrier ahead of her. Gazing up, she
saw Dr. Frank and me at the turret
window and waved her white arm in
greeting. And flashed us a smile.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank laughed. &#8220;By the gods of
the airways, there&#8217;s Alta Venza! You
saw that look, Gregg? That was for
me, not you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reasonable enough,&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;But I doubt it&ndash;&ndash;the Venza was nothing
if not impartial.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I wondered</span> what could be taking
Venza now to Mars. I was glad
to see her. She was diverting. Educated.
Well-traveled. Spoke English
with a colloquial, theatrical manner
more characteristic of Great-New York
than of Venus. And for all her light
banter, I would rather put my trust in
her than any Venus girl I had ever met.</p>
<p>The hum of the departing siren was
sounding. Friends and relatives of the
passengers were crowding the exit incline.
The deck was clearing. I had
not seen George Prince come aboard.
And then I thought I saw him down
on the landing stage, just arrived from
a private tube-car. A small, slight figure.
The customs men were around him: I
could only see his head and shoulders.
Pale, girlishly handsome face; long,
black hair to the base of his neck. He
was bareheaded, with the hood of his
traveling-cloak pushed back.</p>
<p>I stared, and I saw that Dr. Frank
was also gazing down. But neither of
us spoke.</p>
<p>Then I said upon impulse, &#8220;Suppose
we go down to the deck, Doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>He acquiesced. We descended to the
lower room of the turret and clambered
down the spider ladder to the upper
deck-level. The head of the arriving incline
was near us. Preceded by two
carriers who were littered with hand-baggage,
George Prince was coming up
the incline. He was closer now. I
recognized him from the type we had
seen in Halsey&#8217;s office.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">And</span> then, with a shock, I saw it
was not so. This was a girl coming
aboard. An arch-light over the incline
showed her clearly when she was
half way up. A girl with her hood
pushed back; her face framed in thick
black hair. I saw now it was not a
man&#8217;s cut of hair; but long braids
coiled up under the dangling hood.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank must have remarked my
amazed expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little beauty, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>We were standing back against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
wall of the superstructure. A passenger
was near us&ndash;&ndash;the Martian whom Dr.
Frank had called Miko. He was loitering
here, quite evidently watching this
girl come aboard. But as I glanced at
him he looked away and casually
sauntered off.</p>
<p>The girl came up and reached the
deck. &#8220;I am in A&nbsp;22,&#8221; she told the
carrier. &#8220;My brother came aboard two
hours ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Frank answered my whisper.
&#8220;That&#8217;s Anita Prince.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was passing quite close to us on
the deck, following the carrier, when
she stumbled and very nearly fell. I
was nearest to her. I leaped forward
and caught her as she went down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>With my arm about her, I raised her
up and set her upon her feet again.
She had twisted her ankle. She balanced
herself upon it. The pain of it
eased up in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;all right&ndash;&ndash;thank you!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">In</span> the dimness of the blue-lit deck,
I met her eyes. I was holding her
with my encircling arm. She was small
and soft against me. Her face, framed
in the thick, black hair, smiled up at
me. Small, oval face&ndash;&ndash;beautiful&ndash;&ndash;yet
firm of chin, and stamped with the
mark of its own individuality. No
empty-headed beauty, this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right, thank you very
much&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I became conscious that I had not
released her. I felt her hands pushing
at me. And then it seemed that for an
instant she yielded and was clinging.
And I met her startled, upflung gaze.
Eyes like a purple night with the sheen
of misty starlight in them.</p>
<p>I heard myself murmuring, &#8220;I beg
your pardon. Yes, of course!&#8221; I released
her.</p>
<p>She thanked me again and followed
the carrier along the deck. She was
limping slightly from the twisted ankle.</p>
<p>An instant, while she had clung to
me&ndash;&ndash;and I had held her. A brief flash
of something, from her eyes to mine&ndash;&ndash;from
mine back to hers. The poets
write that love can be born of such a
glance. The first meeting, across all
the barriers of which love springs unsought,
unbidden&ndash;&ndash;defiant, sometimes.
And the troubadours of old would
sing: &#8220;A fleeting glance; a touch; two
wildly beating hearts&ndash;&ndash;and love was
born.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think, with Anita and me, it must
have been like that....</p>
<p>I stood gazing after her, unconscious
of Dr. Frank, who was watching me
with his humorous smile. And presently,
no more than a quarter beyond
the zero hour, the Planetara got away.
With the dome-windows battened
tightly, we lifted from the landing
stage and soared over the glowing city.
The phosphorescence of the electronic
tubes was like a comet&#8217;s tail behind us
as we slid upward.</p>
<p>At the trinight hour the heat of our
atmospheric passage was over. The
passengers had all retired. The ship
was quiet, with empty decks and dim,
silent corridors. Vibrationless, with
the electronic engines cut off and only
the hum of the Martel magnetizers to
break the unnatural stillness. We were
well beyond the earth&#8217;s atmosphere,
heading out in the cone-path of the
earth&#8217;s shadow, in the direction of the
moon.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<h4><i>In the Helio-room</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">At</span> six A.&nbsp;M., earth Eastern time,
which we were still carrying,
Snap Dean and I were alone in his instrument
room, perched in the network
over the Planetara&#8217;s deck. The bulge
of the dome enclosed us; it rounded
like a great observatory window some
twenty feet above the ceiling of this
little metal cubby-hole.</p>
<p>The Planetara was still in the earth&#8217;s
shadow. The firmament&ndash;&ndash;black interstellar
space with its blazing white, red
and yellow stars&ndash;&ndash;lay spread around us.
The moon, with nearly all its disc illumined,
hung, a great silver ball, over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
our bow quarter. Behind it, to one
side, Mars floated like the red tip of a
smoldering cigarillo in the blackness.
The earth, behind our stern, was dimly,
redly visible&ndash;&ndash;a giant sphere, etched
with the configurations of its oceans
and continents. Upon one limb a touch
of the sunlight hung on the mountain-tops
with a crescent red-yellow sheen.</p>
<p>And then we plunged from the cone-shadow.
The sun, with the leaping
Corona, burst through the blackness behind
us. The earth lighted into a huge,
thin crescent with hooked cusps.</p>
<p>To Snap and me, the glories of the
heavens were too familiar to be remarked.
And upon this voyage particularly
we were in no mood to consider
them. I had been in the helio-room
several hours. When the Planetara
started, and my few routine duties
were over, I could think of nothing
save Halsey&#8217;s and Carter&#8217;s admonition:
&#8220;Be on your guard. And particularly&ndash;&ndash;watch
George Prince.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had not seen George Prince. But
I had seen his sister, whom Carter and
Halsey had not bothered to mention.
My heart was still pounding with the
memory....</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">When</span> the passengers had retired
and the ship quieted, I prowled
through the passenger corridors. This
was about the trinight hour.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> Hot as
the corridors of hell, with our hull and
the glassite dome seething with the
friction of our atmospheric flight. But
the refrigerators mitigated that; the
ventilators blasted cold air from the renewers
into every corner of the vessel.
Within an hour or two, with the cold
of space striking us, it was hot air that
was needed.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank evidently was having little
trouble with pressure-sick passengers<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>&ndash;&ndash;the
Planetara&#8217;s equalizers were
fairly efficient. I did not encounter Dr.
Frank. I prowled through the silent
metal lounges and passages. I went to
the door of A&nbsp;22. It was on the deck-level,
in a tiny transverse passage just
off the main lounging room. Its name-grid
glowed with the letters: <a name='TC_4'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Added beginning quotes">&#8220;<i>Anita
Prince.</i>&#8221;</ins> I stood in my short white
trousers and white silk shirt, like a
cabin steward gawping. Anita Prince!
I had never heard the name until this
night. But there was magic music in
it now, as I murmured it to myself.
Anita Prince....</p>
<p>She was here, doubtless asleep, behind
this small metal door. It seemed
as though that little oval grid were the
gateway to a fairyland of my dreams.</p>
<p>I turned away. And thought of the
Grantline Moon Expedition stabbed at
me. George Prince&ndash;&ndash;Anita&#8217;s brother&ndash;&ndash;he
whom I had been told to watch.
This renegade&ndash;&ndash;associate of dubious
Martians, plotting God knows what.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I saw</span>, upon the adjoining door, &#8220;A&nbsp;20,
<i>George Prince</i>.&#8221; I listened. In
the humming stillness of the ship&#8217;s interior
there was no sound from these
cabins. A&nbsp;20 was without windows, I
knew. But Anita&#8217;s room had a window
and a door which gave upon the deck.
I went through the lounge, out its arch,
and walked the deck length. The deck
door and window of A&nbsp;22 were closed
and dark.</p>
<p>The ten-foot-wide deck was dim with
white starlight from the side ports.
Chairs were here, but they were all
empty. From the bow windows of the
arching dome a flood of moonlight
threw long, slanting shadows down the
deck. At the corner where the superstructure
ended, I thought I saw a figure
lurking as though watching me. I
went that way, but it vanished.</p>
<p>I turned the corner, went the width
of the ship to the other side. There
was no one in sight save the observer
on his spider bridge, high in the bow
network, and the second officer, on duty
on the turret balcony almost directly
over me.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></div>
<p>As I stood and listened, I suddenly
heard footsteps. From the direction of
the bow a figure came. Purser Johnson.</p>
<p>He greeted me. &#8220;Cooling off, Gregg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He went past me and turned into the
smoking room door nearby.</p>
<p>I stood a moment at one of the deck
windows, gazing at the stars; and for
no reason at all I realized I was tense.
Johnson was a great one for his regular
sleep&ndash;&ndash;it was wholly unlike him to be
roaming about the ship at such an hour.
Had he been watching me? I told myself
it was nonsense. I was suspicious
of everyone, everything, this voyage.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I heard</span> another step. Captain Carter
appeared from his chart-room
which stood in the center of the narrowing
open deck space near the bow.
I joined him at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was that?&#8221; he half-whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221; He fumbled in his uniform;
his gaze swept the moonlit deck.
&#8220;Gregg&ndash;&ndash;take this.&#8221; He handed me a
small metal box. I stuffed it at once
into my shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;An insulator,&#8221; he added, swiftly.
&#8220;Snap is in his office. Take it to him,
Gregg. Stay with him&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll have a
measure of security&ndash;&ndash;and you can help
him to make the photographs.&#8221; He was
barely whispering. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be with
you&ndash;&ndash;no use making it look as though
we were doing anything unusual. If
your graphs show anything&ndash;&ndash;or if Snap
picks up any message&ndash;&ndash;bring it to me.&#8221;
He added aloud, &#8220;Well, it will be cool
enough presently, Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sauntered away toward his chart-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;By heavens, what a relief!&#8221; Snap
murmured as the current went on. We
had wired his cubby with the insulator;
within its barrage we could at last talk
with a degree of freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen George Prince, Gregg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He&#8217;s assigned A&nbsp;20. But I
saw his sister. Snap, no one ever mentioned&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap had heard of her, but he hadn&#8217;t
known that she was listed for this voyage.
&#8220;A real beauty, so I&#8217;ve heard. Accursed
shame for a decent girl to have
a brother like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could agree with him there, but I
made no comment.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It</span> was now 6 A.&nbsp;M. Snap had been
busy all night with routine cosmo-radios
from the earth, following our
departure. He had a pile of them beside
him. Many were for the passengers;
but anything that savored of a
code was barred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing queer looking?&#8221; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Not a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were at this time no more than
some sixty-five thousand miles from the
moon&#8217;s surface. The Planetara presently
would swing upon her direct
course for Mars. There was nothing
which could cause passenger comment
in this close passing of the moon; normally
we used the satellite&#8217;s attraction
to give us additional starting speed.</p>
<p>It was now or never that a message
would come from Grantline. He was
supposed to be upon this earthward
side of the moon. While Snap had
rushed through with his routine, I had
searched the moon surface with our
glass, as I knew Carter was searching
it&ndash;&ndash;and also the observer in his tower,
very possibly.</p>
<p>But there was nothing. Copernicus
and Kepler lay in full sunlight. The
heights of the lunar mountains, the
depths of the barren, empty seas were
etched black and white, clear and clean.
Grim, forbidding desolation, this unchanging
moon! In romance, moonlight
may shimmer and sparkle to light
a lover&#8217;s smile; but the reality of the
moon is cold and bleak. There was
nothing to show my prying eyes where
the intrepid Grantline might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all, Snap.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Snap&#8217;s helio mirrors, attuned
for an hour now to pick up the faintest
signal, were motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he has concentrated any appreciable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
amount of radio-active ore,&#8221; said
Snap, &#8220;we should get an impulse from
its Gamma rays.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">But</span> our receiving shield was dark,
untouched. We tried taking
hydrogen photographic impressions of
the visible moon surface. A sequence of
them, with stereoscopic lenses, forty-eight
to the second. Our mirror-grid
gave the magnified images; the spectro-heliograph,
with its wave-length selection,
pictured the mountain-levels, and
slowly descended into the deepest seas.</p>
<p>There was nothing.</p>
<p>Yet in those moon caverns&ndash;&ndash;a million
million recesses amid the crags of that
tumbled, barren surface&ndash;&ndash;the pin-point
of movement which might have been
Grantline&#8217;s expedition could so easily
be hiding! Could he have the ore insulated,
fearing its Gamma rays would
betray its presence to hostile watchers?</p>
<p>Or might disaster have come to him?
Or he might not be upon this hemisphere
of the moon at all....</p>
<p>My imagination, sharpened by fancy
of a lurking menace which seemed
everywhere about the Planetara this
voyage, ran rife with fears for Johnny
Grantline. He had promised to communicate
this voyage. It was now, or
perhaps never.</p>
<p>Six-thirty came and passed. We
were well beyond the earth&#8217;s shadow
now. The firmament blazed with its
vivid glories; the sun behind us was a
ball of yellow-red leaping flames. The
earth hung, opened to a huge, dull-red
half-sphere.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> were within some forty thousand
miles of the moon. Giant
white ball&ndash;&ndash;all of its disc visible to the
naked eye. It poised over the bow, and
presently, as the Planetara swung upon
her course for Mars, it shifted sidewise.
The light of it glared white and
dazzling in our tiny side windows.</p>
<p>Snap, with his habitual red celluloid
eyeshade shoved high on his forehead,
worked over our instruments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg!&#8221;</p>
<p>The receiving shield was glowing a
trifle! Gamma rays were bombarding
it! It glowed, gleamed phosphorescent,
and the audible recorder began sounding
its tiny tinkling murmurs.</p>
<p>Gamma rays! Snap sprang to the
dials. The direction and strength were
soon obvious. A richly radio-active
ore body, of considerable size, was
concentrated upon this hemisphere of
the moon! It was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got it, Gregg! He&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The tiny helio mirrors began quivering.
Snap exclaimed triumphantly,
&#8220;Here he comes! By God, the message
at last! Bar off that light!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I flung</span> on the absorbers. The
moonlight bathing the little room
went into them and darkness sprang
around us. Snap fumbled at his instrument
board. Actinic light showed
dimly in the quivering, thumbnail mirrors.
Two of them. They hung poised
on their cobweb wires, infinitely sensitive
to the infra-red light-rays Grantline
was sending from the moon. The
mirrors in a moment began swinging.
On the scale across the room the actinic
beams from them were magnified into
sweeps of light.</p>
<p>The message!</p>
<p>Snap spelled it out, decoded it.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Success! Stop for ore on your return
voyage. Will give you our location
later. Success beyond wildest
hopes&ndash;&ndash;</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The mirrors hung motionless. The
shield, where the Gamma rays were
bombarding, went suddenly dark.</p>
<p>Snap murmured, &#8220;That&#8217;s all. He&#8217;s
got the ore! &#8216;Success beyond wildest
hopes.&#8217; That must mean an enormous
quantity of it available!&#8221;</p>
<p>We were sitting in darkness, and
abruptly I became aware that across
our open window, where the insulation
barrage was flung, the air was faintly
hissing. An interference there! I saw
a tiny swirl of purple sparks. Someone&ndash;&ndash;some
hostile ray from the deck beneath
us, or from the spider bridge that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
led to our little room&ndash;&ndash;someone out
there trying to pry in!</p>
<p>Snap impulsively reached for the absorbers
to let in the outside light&ndash;&ndash;it
was all darkness to us outside. But I
checked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; I cut off our barrage,
opened our door and stepped to the
narrow metal bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Snap! You stay there.&#8221; I
added aloud, &#8220;Well, Snap, I&#8217;m going
to bed. Glad you&#8217;ve cleaned up that
batch of work.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I banged</span> the door upon him. The
lacework of metal bridges and ladders
seemed empty. I gazed up to the
dome, and forward and aft. Twenty
feet beneath me was the metal roof of
the cabin superstructure. Below it,
both sides of the deck showed. All
patched with moonlight.</p>
<p>No one visible down there. I descended
a ladder. The deck was empty.
But in the silence something was moving!
Footsteps moving away from me
down the deck! I followed; and suddenly
I was running. Chasing something
I could hear, but could not see.
It turned into the smoking room.</p>
<p>I burst in. And a real sound smothered
the phantom. Johnson the purser
was sitting here alone in the dimness.
He was smoking. I noticed that his
cigar held a long, frail ash. It could
not have been him I was chasing. He
was sitting there quite calmly. A thick-necked,
heavy fellow, easily out of
breath. But he was breathing calmly
now.</p>
<p>He sat up with amazement at my
wild-eyed appearance, and the ash
jarred from his cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg! What in the devil&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to grin. &#8220;I&#8217;m on my way to
bed&ndash;&ndash;worked all night helping Snap
with those damn Earth messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went past him, out the door into
the main interior corridor. It was the
only way the invisible prowler could
have gone. But I was too late now&ndash;&ndash;I
could hear nothing. I dashed forward
into the main lounge. It was
empty, dim and silent, a silence broken
presently by a faint click&ndash;&ndash;a stateroom
door hastily closing. I swung and
found myself in a tiny transverse passage.
The twin doors of A&nbsp;22 and A&nbsp;20
were before me.</p>
<p>The invisible eavesdropper had gone
into one of these rooms! I listened at
each of the panels, but there was only
silence within.</p>
<p>The interior of the ship was suddenly
singing with the steward&#8217;s siren&ndash;&ndash;the
call to awaken the passengers. It
startled me. I moved swiftly away. But
as the siren shut off, in the silence I
heard a soft, musical voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake up, Anita&ndash;&ndash;I think that&#8217;s the
breakfast call.&#8221;</p>
<p>And her answer: &#8220;All right, George.
I hear it.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h4><i>A Burn on a Martian Arm</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I did</span> not appear at that morning
meal. I was exhausted and drugged
with lack of sleep. I had a moment
with Snap, to tell him what had occurred.
Then I sought out Carter. He
had his little chart-room insulated. And
we were cautious. I told him what
Snap and I had learned: the Gamma
rays from the moon, proving that
Grantline had concentrated a considerable
ore-body. I also told him the message
from Grantline.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop on the way back, as he
directs, Gregg.&#8221; He bent closer to me.
&#8220;At Ferrok-Shahn I&#8217;m going to bring
back a cordon of Interplanetary Police.
The secret will be out, of course, when
once we stop at the moon. We have no
right, even now, to be flying this vessel
as unguarded as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was very solemn. And he was
grim when I told him of the invisible
eavesdropper.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think he overheard Grantline&#8217;s
message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it? You seem to feel it
was George Prince?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>I was convinced that the prowler had
gone into A&nbsp;20. When I mentioned the
purser, who seemed to have been
watching me earlier in the night, and
again was sitting in the smoking room
when the <a name='TC_5'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'eavesdroopper'">eavesdropper</ins> fled past, Carter
looked startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson is all right, Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he? Does he know anything
about this Grantline affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;no,&#8221; said the captain hastily.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t mentioned it, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I haven&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been wondering
why Johnson didn&#8217;t hear that
eavesdropper. I could hear him when
I was chasing him. But Johnson sat
perfectly unmoved and let him go by.
What was he sitting there for, anyway,
at that hour of the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too suspicious, Gregg. Overwrought.
But you&#8217;re right&ndash;&ndash;we can&#8217;t
be too careful. I&#8217;m going to have that
Prince suite searched when I catch it
unoccupied. Passengers don&#8217;t ordinarily
travel with invisible cloaks. Go
to bed, Gregg&ndash;&ndash;you need a rest.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I went</span> to my cabin. It was located
aft, on the stern deck-space, near
the stern watch-tower. A small metal
room, with a desk, a chair and bunk. I
made sure no one was in it. I sealed
the lattice grill and the door, set the
alarm trigger against any opening of
them, and went to bed.</p>
<p>The siren for the mid-day meal
awakened me. I had slept heavily. I
felt refreshed. And hungry.</p>
<p>I found the passengers already assembled
at my table when I arrived in
the dining salon. It was a low-vaulted
metal room of blue and yellow tube-lights.
At the sides its oval windows
showed the deck, with its ports of the
dome-side, through which a vista of the
starry firmament was visible. We were
well on our course to Mars. The moon
had dwindled to a pin-point of light
beside the crescent earth. And behind
them our sun blazed, visually the largest
orb in the heavens. It was some
sixty-eight million miles from the earth
to Mars, this voyage. A flight, under
ordinary circumstances, of some ten
days.</p>
<p>There were five tables in the dining
salon, each with eight seats. Snap and
I had one of the tables. We sat at the
ends, with three passengers on each of
the sides.</p>
<p>Snap was in his seat when I arrived.
He eyed me down the length of the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Gregg. We missed
you at breakfast. Not <a name='TC_7'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'pressure-cick'">pressure-sick</ins>, I
hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>There were three passengers already
seated at our table&ndash;&ndash;all men. Snap, in
a gay mood, introduced me.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our third officer, Gregg Haljan.
Big, handsome fellow, isn&#8217;t he?
And as pleasant as he is good-looking.
Gregg, this is Sero Ob Hahn.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I met</span> the keen, dark-eyed somber
gaze of a Venus man of middle age.
A small, slim, graceful man, with sleek
black hair. His pointed face, accentuated
by the pointed beard, was pallid.
He wore a white and purple robe; upon
his breast was a huge platinum ornament,
a device like a star and cross entwined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to meet you, sir.&#8221; His
voice was soft and sleek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ob Hahn,&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;I should
have heard of you, no doubt. But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile plucked at his thin, gray
lips. &#8220;That is the error of mine, not
yours. My mission is that all the universe
shall hear of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s preaching the religion of the
Venus Mystics,&#8221; Snap explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this enlightened gentleman,&#8221;
said Ob Hahn ironically, &#8220;has just
termed it fetishism. The ignorance&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say!&#8221; protested the man at Ob
Hahn&#8217;s side. &#8220;I mean, you seem to think
I intended something opprobrious. As
a matter of fact&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve an argument, Gregg,&#8221;
laughed Snap. &#8220;This is Sir Arthur
Coniston, an English gentleman, lecturer
and sky-trotter&ndash;&ndash;that is, he will
be a sky-trotter; he tells us he plans a
number of voyages.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>The tall Englishman in his white
linen suit bowed acknowledgment. &#8220;My
compliments, Mr. Haljan. I hope you
have no strong religious convictions,
else we will make your table here very
miserable!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> third passenger had evidently
kept out of the argument. Snap
introduced him as Rance Rankin. An
American&ndash;&ndash;a quiet, blond fellow of
thirty-five or forty.</p>
<p>I ordered my breakfast and let the
argument go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t make me miserable,&#8221; said
Snap. &#8220;I love an argument. You said,
Sir Arthur?...</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to say, I think I said too
much. Mr. Rankin, you are more diplomatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rankin laughed. &#8220;I am a magician,&#8221;
he said to me. &#8220;A theatrical entertainer.
I deal in tricks&ndash;&ndash;how to fool an audience&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
His keen, amused gaze was on
Ob Hahn. &#8220;This gentleman from Venus
and I have too much in common to
argue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nasty one!&#8221; the Englishman exclaimed.
&#8220;By Jove! Really, Mr. Rankin,
you&#8217;re a bit too cruel!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could see we were doomed to have
turbulent meals this voyage. I like to
eat in quiet; arguing passengers always
annoy me. There were still three seats
vacant at our table; I wondered who
would occupy them. I soon learned
the answer&ndash;&ndash;for one seat at least. Rankin
said calmly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the little Venus girl this
meal?&#8221; His glance went to the empty
seat at my right hand. &#8220;The Venza&ndash;&ndash;wasn&#8217;t
that her name? She and I are
destined for the same theater in Ferrok-Shahn.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Venza was to sit beside me. It
was good news. Ten days of a religious
argument three times a day would be
intolerable. But the cheerful Venza
would help.</p>
<p>&#8220;She never eats the mid-day meal,&#8221;
said Snap. &#8220;She&#8217;s on the deck, having
orange juice. I guess it&#8217;s the old gag
about diet, eh?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">My</span> attention wandered about the
salon. Most of the seats were
occupied. At the captain&#8217;s table I saw
the objects of my search. George
Prince and his sister sat one on each
side of the captain. I saw George
Prince in the life now as a man who
looked hardly twenty-five. He was at
this moment evidently in a gay mood.
His clean-cut, handsome profile, with
its poetic dark curls, was turned toward
me. There seemed little of the villain
about him.</p>
<p>And I saw Anita Prince now as a
dark-haired, black eyed little beauty, in
feature resembling her brother very
strongly. She presently finished her
meal. She rose, with him after her.
She was dressed in Earth fashion&ndash;&ndash;white
blouse and dark jacket, wide,
knee-length trousers of gray, with a
red sash her only touch of color. She
went past me, flashed me her smile and
nod.</p>
<p>My heart was pounding. I answered
her greeting, and met George Prince&#8217;s
casual gaze. He, too, smiled, as though
to signify that his sister had told him
of the service I had done her. Or was
his smile an ironical memory of how
he had eluded me this morning when I
chased him?</p>
<p>I gazed after his small, white-suited
figure as he followed Anita from the
salon. And thinking of her, I prayed
that Carter and Halsey might be wrong.
Whatever plotting against the Grantline
Expedition might be going on, I
hoped that George Prince was innocent
of it. Yet I knew in my heart it was a
futile hope. Prince had been that
eavesdropper outside the helio-room. I
could not really doubt it. But that his
sister must be ignorant of what he was
doing, I was sure.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">My</span> attention was brought suddenly
back to the reality of our
table. I heard Ob Hahn&#8217;s silky voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;We passed quite close to the moon
last night, Mr. Dean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Snap. &#8220;We did, didn&#8217;t
we? Always do&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s a technical problem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
of the exigencies of interstellar
navigation. Explain it to them, Gregg&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re
an expert.&#8221;</p>
<p>I waved it away with a laugh. There
was a brief silence. I could not help
noticing Sir Arthur Coniston&#8217;s queer
look, and I think I have never seen so
keen a glance as Rance Rankin shot at
me. Were all these people aware of
Grantline&#8217;s treasure on the moon? It
suddenly seemed so. I wished fervently
at that instant that the ten days
of this voyage were over and we were
safely at Ferrok-Shahn. Captain Carter
was absolutely right. Coming back
we would have a cordon of interplanetary
police aboard.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur broke the awkward silence.
&#8220;Magnificent sight, the moon,
from so close a viewpoint&ndash;&ndash;though I
was too much afraid of pressure-sickness
to be up to see it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I had</span> nearly finished my hasty meal
when another incident shocked me.
The two other passengers at our table
came in and took their seats. A Martian
girl and man. The girl had the
seat at my left, with the man beside
her. All Martians are tall. This girl
was about my own height&ndash;&ndash;that is, six
feet, two inches. The man was seven
feet or more. Both wore the Martian
outer robe. The girl flung hers back.
Her limbs were encased in pseudo-mail.
She looked, as all Martians like to look,
a very warlike Amazon. But she was a
pretty girl. She smiled at me with a
keen-eyed, direct gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dean said at breakfast that you
were big and handsome. You are.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were brother and sister, these
Martians. Snap introduced them as Set
Miko and Setta Moa.<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a></p>
<p>This Miko was, from our Earth
standards, a tremendous, brawny giant.
Not spindly, like most Martians, this
fellow, for all his seven feet of height,
was almost heavy-set. He wore a
plaited leather jerkin beneath his robe,
and knee pants of leather out of which
his lower legs showed as gray, hairy
pillars of strength. He had come into
the salon with a swagger, his sword-ornament
clanking.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pleasant voyage so far,&#8221; he said to
me as he started his meal. His voice
had the heavy, throaty rasp characteristic
of the Martian. He spoke perfect
English&ndash;&ndash;both Martians and Venus
people are by heritage extraordinary
<a name='TC_9'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'linquists'">linguists</ins>. Miko and his sister Moa had
a touch of Martian accent, worn almost
away by living for some years in Great-New
York.</p>
<p>The shock to me came within a few
minutes. Miko, absorbed in attacking
his meal, inadvertently pushed back his
robe to bare his forearm. An instant
only, then it dropped again to his wrist.
But in that instant I had seen, upon the
gray flesh, a thin sear turned red. A
very recent burn&ndash;&ndash;as though a pencil-ray
of heat had caught his arm.</p>
<p>My mind flung back. Only last night
in the City Corridor, Snap and I had
been followed by a Martian. I had shot
at him with the heat-ray; I thought I
had hit him on the arm. Was this the
mysterious Martian who had followed
us from Halsey&#8217;s office?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<h4><i>Venza the Venus Girl</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It was</span> shortly after that mid-day
meal when I encountered Venza
sitting on the starlit deck. I had been
in the bow observatory; taken my
routine castings of our position and
worked them out. I was, I think, of
the Planetara&#8217;s officers the most expert
handler of the mathematical mechanical
calculators. The locating of our
position and charting the trajectory of
our course was, under ordinary circumstances,
about all I had to do. And it
took only a few minutes each twelve
hours.</p>
<p>I had a moment with Carter in the
isolation of his chart-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;This voyage! Gregg, I&#8217;m getting
like you&ndash;&ndash;too fanciful. We&#8217;ve a normal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
group of passengers, apparently; but I
don&#8217;t like the look of any of them. That
Ob Hahn, at your table&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snaky-looking fellow,&#8221; I commented.
&#8220;He and the Englishman are
great on arguments. Did you have
Prince&#8217;s cabin <a name='TC_10'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Added end quote">searched?&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>My breath hung on his answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Nothing unusual among his
things. We searched both his room and
his sister&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not follow that up. Instead I
told him about the burn on Miko&#8217;s
thick gray arm.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> stared. &#8220;I wish to the Almighty
we were at Ferrok-Shahn.
Gregg, to-night when the passengers
are asleep, come here to me.
Snap will be here, and Dr. Frank. We
can trust him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows about&ndash;&ndash;about the Grantline
treasure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And so do Balch and Blackstone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balch and Blackstone were our first
and second officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all meet here, Gregg&ndash;&ndash;say
about the zero hour. We must take
some precautions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He suddenly felt he should say no
more now. He dismissed me.</p>
<p>I found Venza seated alone in a secluded
corner of the starlit deck. A
porthole, with the black heavens and
the blazing stars, was before her. There
was an empty seat nearby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hola-lo,<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> Gregg! Sit here with me.
I have been wondering when you would
come after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat down beside her. &#8220;What are
you doing&ndash;&ndash;going to Mars, Venza? I&#8217;m
glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many thanks. But I am glad to see
you, Gregg. So handsome a man....
Do you know, from Venus to the earth
and I have no doubt on all of Mars, no
man will please me more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glib tongue,&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;Born to
flatter the male&ndash;&ndash;every girl of your
world.&#8221; And I added seriously, &#8220;You
don&#8217;t answer my question? What takes
you to Mars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Contract. By the stars, what else?
Of course, a chance to make a voyage
with you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Venza.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I enjoyed</span> her. I gazed at her
small, slim figure gracefully reclining
in the deck chair. Her long, gray
robe parted&ndash;&ndash;by design, I have no
doubt&ndash;&ndash;to display her shapely, satin-sheathed
legs. Her black hair was
coiled in a heavy knot at the back of
her neck; her carmined lips were
parted with a mocking, alluring smile.
The exotic perfume of her enveloped
me.</p>
<p>She glanced at me sidewise from beneath
her sweeping black lashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be serious,&#8221; I added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am serious. Sober. Intoxicated
by you, but sober.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;What sort of a contract?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A theater in Ferrok-Shahn. Good
money, Gregg. I&#8217;m to be there a year.&#8221;
She sat up to face me. &#8220;There&#8217;s a fellow
here on the Planetara, Rance Rankin,
he calls himself. At our table&ndash;&ndash;a
big, good-looking blond American. He
says he is a magician. Ever hear of
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he told me. No, I never
heard of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor did I. And I thought I had
heard of everyone of any importance.
He is listed for the same theater where
I&#8217;m going. Nice sort of fellow.&#8221; She
paused, and added suddenly, &#8220;If he&#8217;s a
professional entertainer, I&#8217;m a motor-oiler.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It</span> startled me. &#8220;Why do you say
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instinctively my gaze swept the
deck. An Earth woman and child and
a small Venus man were in sight, but
not within earshot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you look so furtive?&#8221; she
retorted. &#8220;Gregg, there&#8217;s something
strange about this voyage. I&#8217;m no fool,
nor you, and you know it as well as I
do.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Rance Rankin&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; I prompted.</p>
<p>She leaned closer toward me. &#8220;He
could fool you. But not me&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve
known too many real magicians.&#8221; She
grinned. &#8220;I challenged him to trick
me. You should have seen him trying
to evade!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Ob Hahn?&#8221; I interrupted.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;Never heard of
him. But he told me plenty at breakfast.
By Satan, what a flow of words
that devil-driver can muster! He and
the Englishman don&#8217;t mesh very well,
do they?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared at me. I had not answered
her grin; my mind was too busy with
queer fancies. Halsey&#8217;s words: &#8220;Things
are not always what they seem&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Were
these passengers masqueraders? Put
here by George Prince? And then I
thought of Miko the Martian, and the
burn upon his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back, Gregg! Don&#8217;t go wandering
off like that!&#8221; She dropped her
voice to a whisper. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be serious. I
want to know what in the hell is going
on aboard this ship. I&#8217;m a woman, and
I&#8217;m curious. You tell me.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hat</span> do you mean?&#8221; I parried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean a lot of things. What we&#8217;ve
just been talking about. And what was
the excitement you were in just before
breakfast this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excitement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg, you may trust me.&#8221; For the
first time she was wholly serious. Her
gaze made sure no one was within hearing.
She put her hand on my arm. I
could barely hear her whisper: &#8220;I know
they might have a ray upon us&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll be
careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone. Something&#8217;s going on.
You know it&ndash;&ndash;you are in it. I saw you
this morning, Gregg. Wild-eyed, chasing
a phantom&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I heard the phantom! A man&#8217;s
footsteps. A magnetic reflecting invisible
cloak. You couldn&#8217;t fool an
audience with that&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s too commonplace.
If Rance Rankin tried&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I gripped her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ramble, Venza!
You saw me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. My stateroom door was open.
I was sitting with a cigarillo. I saw
the purser in the smoking room. He
was visible from&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! Venza, that prowler went
through the smoking room!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he did. I could hear him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the purser hear him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. The purser looked up,
followed the sound with his gaze. I
thought that was queer. He never made
a move. And then you came along and
he acted innocent. Why? What&#8217;s going
on, that&#8217;s what I want to know!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I held</span> my breath. &#8220;Venza, where
did the prowler run to? Can you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She whispered calmly, &#8220;Into A&nbsp;20.
I saw the door open and close&ndash;&ndash;I even
think I could see the blurred outline of
him. Those magnetic cloaks!&#8221; She
added, &#8220;Why should George Prince be
sneaking around with you after him?
And the purser acting innocent? And
who is this George Prince, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>The huge Martian, Miko, with his
sister Moa came strolling along the
deck. They nodded as they passed us.</p>
<p>I whispered, &#8220;I can&#8217;t explain anything
now. But you&#8217;re right, Venza:
there is something going on. Listen!
Whatever you learn&ndash;&ndash;anything you encounter
which looks unusual&ndash;&ndash;will you
tell me? I&ndash;&ndash;well, I do trust you&ndash;&ndash;really
I do!&ndash;&ndash;but the thing isn&#8217;t mine to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The somber pools of her eyes were
shining. &#8220;You are very lovable, Gregg.
I won&#8217;t question you.&#8221; She was trembling
with excitement. &#8220;Whatever it
is, I want to be in it. Here&#8217;s something
I can tell you now. We&#8217;ve two high-class
gold-leaf gamblers aboard. Did
you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Who are&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shac and Dud Ardley. Let me state
every detective in Great-New York
knows them. They had a wonderful
game with that Englishman, Sir Arthur
Coniston, this morning. Stripped him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
of half a pound of eight-inch leaves&ndash;&ndash;a
neat little stack. A crooked game, of
course. Those fellows are more nimble-fingered
than Rance Rankin ever dared
to be!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I sat</span> staring at her. She was a
mine of information, this girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Gregg, I tried my charms on
Shac and Dud. Nice men, but dumb.
Whatever&#8217;s going on, they&#8217;re not in it.
They wanted to know what kind of a
ship this was. Why? Because Shac
has a cute little eavesdropping microphone
of his own. He had it working
in the night last night. He overheard
George Prince and that big giant Miko
arguing about the moon!&#8221;</p>
<p>I gasped. &#8220;Venza, softer!&#8221;</p>
<p>Against all propriety of this public
deck she pretended to drape herself
upon me. Her hair smothered my face
as her lips almost touched my ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something about treasure on the
moon&ndash;&ndash;Shac couldn&#8217;t understand what.
And they mentioned you. He didn&#8217;t
hear what they said because the purser
joined them.&#8221; Her whispered words
tumbled over one another. &#8220;A hundred
pounds of gold leaf&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s the purser&#8217;s
price. He&#8217;s with them, whatever it is.
He promised to do something for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped. &#8220;Well?&#8221; I prompted.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all. Shac&#8217;s current was interrupted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him to try it again, Venza! I&#8217;ll
talk with him. No! I&#8217;d better let him
alone. Can you get him to keep his
mouth shut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he might do anything I told
him. He&#8217;s a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find out what you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat away from me suddenly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s Anita and George Prince.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">They</span> came to the corner of the
deck, but turned back. Venza
caught my look. And understood it.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you love Anita Prince so much
as that, Gregg?&#8221; Venza was smiling.
&#8220;I wish you&ndash;&ndash;I wish some man handsome
as you would gaze after me like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned solemn. &#8220;You may be interested
to know that she loves you.
I could see it. I knew it when I mentioned
you to her this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Why, we&#8217;ve hardly spoken!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it necessary? I never heard that
it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not see Venza&#8217;s face; she
stood up suddenly. And when I rose
beside her, she whispered,</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not be seen talking so
long. I&#8217;ll find out what I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stared after her slight robed figure
as she turned into the lounge archway
and vanished.</p>

<p>Snap, Dr. Frank, Balch, our first officer,

It was 4 P.&nbsp;M.&ndash;&ndash;our Earth starting

<p>He closed his window upon an
American woman passenger who was
demanding details of Martian currency,
and followed me forward. &#8220;What is it,
Gregg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Carter banged the slide upon
us. The chart-room was insulated. The
hum of the current was obvious. Johnson
noticed it. He started at the hostile
faces of the surgeon and Balch. And he
tried to bluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this? Something wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter wasted no words. &#8220;We have
information, Johnson&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s some
under cover plot here aboard. I want
to know what it is. Suppose you tell
us frankly.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> purser looked blank. &#8220;What
do you mean? We&#8217;ve gamblers
aboard, if that&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To hell with that,&#8221; growled Balch.
&#8220;You had a secret interview with that
Martian, Set Miko, and with George
Prince!&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson scowled from under his
heavy brows, and then raised them in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I? You mean changing their
money? I don&#8217;t like your tone, Balch.
I&#8217;m not your under-officer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re under me,&#8221; roared the
captain. &#8220;By God, I&#8217;m master here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not disputing that,&#8221; said
the purser mildly. &#8220;This fellow
Balch&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in no mood for argument,&#8221;
Dr. Frank cut in. &#8220;Clouding the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let it be clouded,&#8221; the captain
exclaimed. I had never seen Carter
so choleric. He was evidently under a
tremendous strain. He added,</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson, you&#8217;ve been acting suspiciously.
I don&#8217;t give a damn whether
I&#8217;ve proof of it or not&ndash;&ndash;I say it. Did
you, or did you not meet George Prince
and that Martian last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not. And I don&#8217;t mind
telling you, Captain Carter, that your
tone also is offensive!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; Carter suddenly seized him.
They were both big men. Johnson&#8217;s
heavy face went purplish red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your hands!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; They were
struggling. Carter&#8217;s hands were fumbling
at the purser&#8217;s pockets. I leaped,
flung an arm around Johnson&#8217;s neck,
pinning him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy there! We&#8217;ve got you, Johnson!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Snap</span> tried to help me. &#8220;Go on, bang
him on the head, Gregg. Now&#8217;s
your chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>We searched him. A heat-ray cylinder&ndash;&ndash;that
was legitimate. But we found a
small battery and eavesdropping microphone
similar to the one Venza had
mentioned that Shac the gambler was
carrying.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing with that?&#8221; the
captain demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of your business! Is it criminal?
Carter, I&#8217;ll have the Line officials
dismiss you for this! Take your hands
off me, all of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at this!&#8221; exclaimed Dr. Frank.</p>
<p>From Johnson&#8217;s breast pocket the
surgeon drew a folded document. It
was the scale drawing of the Planetara&#8217;s
interior corridors, the lower control
rooms and mechanisms. It was always
kept in Johnson&#8217;s safe. And with
it, another document: the ship&#8217;s clearance
papers&ndash;&ndash;the secret code pass-words
for this voyage, to be used if we
should be challenged by any interplanetary
police ship.</p>
<p>Snap gasped. &#8220;My God, that was in
my helio-room strong box! I&#8217;m the only
one on this vessel except the captain
who&#8217;s entitled to know those pass-words!&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of the silence, Balch demanded,
&#8220;Well, what about it, Johnson?&#8221;</p>
<p>The purser was still defiant. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
answer your questions, Balch. At the
proper time, I&#8217;ll explain&ndash;&ndash;Gregg Haljan,
you&#8217;re choking me!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I eased</span> up. But I shook him.
&#8220;You&#8217;d better talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was exasperatingly silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; exploded Carter. &#8220;He can
explain when we get to port. Meanwhile
I&#8217;ll put him where he&#8217;ll do no
more damage. Gregg, lock him in the
cage.&#8221;</p>
<p>We ignored his violent protestations.
The cage&ndash;&ndash;in the old days of sea-vessels
on Earth, they called it the brig&ndash;&ndash;was
the ship&#8217;s jail. A steel-lined, windowless
room located under the deck
in the peak of the bow. I dragged the
struggling Johnson there, with the
amazed watcher looking down from the
observatory window at our lunging,
starlit forms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Johnson! If you know
what&#8217;s good for you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was making a fearful commotion.
Behind us, where the deck narrowed
at the superstructure, half a dozen
passengers were gazing in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have you thrown out of the Service,
Gregg Haljan!&#8221;</p>
<p>I shut him up finally. And flung him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
down the ladder into the cage and
sealed the deck trap-door upon him. I
was headed back for the chart-room
when from the observatory came the
lookout&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;An asteroid, Haljan! Officer Blackstone
wants you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hurried to the turret bridge. An
asteroid was in sight. We had attained
nearly our maximum speed now. An
asteroid was approaching, so dangerously
close that our trajectory would
have to be altered. I heard Blackstone&#8217;s
signals ringing in the control
rooms; and met Carter as he ran to the
bridge with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;That scoundrel! We&#8217;ll get more out
of him, Gregg. By God, I&#8217;ll put the
chemicals on him&ndash;&ndash;torture him, illegal
or not!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> had no time for further discussion.
The asteroid was rapidly
approaching. Already, under the
glass, it was a magnificent sight. I had
never seen this tiny world before&ndash;&ndash;asteroids
are not numerous between the
Earth and Mars, or in toward Venus.
I never expected to see this one again.
How little of the future can we humans
fathom, for all our science! If I could
only have looked into the future, even
for a few short hours! How different
then would have been the outcome of
this tragic voyage!</p>
<p>The asteroid came rushing at us. Its
orbital velocity, I later computed, was
some twenty-two miles a second. Our
own, at the present maximum, was a
fraction over seventy-seven. The asteroid
had for some time been under observation
by the lookout. He gave his
warning only when it seemed that our
trajectory should be altered to avoid
a dangerously close passing.</p>
<p>At the combined speeds of nearly
a hundred miles a second the asteroid
swept into view. With the naked eye,
at first it was a tiny speck of star-dust,
unnoticed in the gem-strewn black
velvet of Space. A speck. Then a
gleaming dot, silver white, with the
light of our Sun upon it.</p>
<p>Five minutes. The dot grew to a disc.
Expanding. A full moon, silver-white.
Brightest world in the firmament&ndash;&ndash;the
light from it bathed the Planetara,
illumined the deck, painting everything
with silver.</p>
<p>I stood with Carter and Blackstone
on the turret bridge. It was obvious
that unless we altered our course, the
asteroid would pass too close for safety.
Already we were feeling its attraction;
from the control rooms came the
report that our trajectory was disturbed
by this new mass so near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better make your calculations now,
Gregg,&#8221; Blackstone suggested.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I cast</span> up the rough elements from
the observational instruments in the
turret. It took me some ten or fifteen
minutes. When I had us upon our new
course, with the attractive and repulsive
plates in the Planetara&#8217;s hull set in
their altered combinations, I went out
to the bridge again.</p>
<p>The asteroid hung over our bow
quarter. No more than twenty or thirty
thousand miles away. A giant ball now,
filling all that quadrant of the heavens.
The configurations of its mountains&ndash;&ndash;its
land and water areas&ndash;&ndash;were plainly
visible. Its axial rotation was apparent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly habitable,&#8221; Blackstone
said. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve searched all over this
hemisphere with the glass. No sign of
human life&ndash;&ndash;certainly nothing civilized&ndash;&ndash;nothing
in the fashion of cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fair little world, by the look of it.
A tiny globe: Blackstone had figured
it at some eight hundred miles in diameter.
There seemed a normal atmosphere.
We could see areas where the
surface was obscured by clouds. And
oceans, and land masses. Polar icecaps.
Lush vegetation at its equator.</p>
<p>Blackstone had roughly cast its orbital
elements. A narrow <a name='TC_11'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'elipse'">ellipse</ins>. No
wonder we had never encountered this
fair little world before. It had come
from the outer region beyond Neptune.
At perihelion it would reach inside
Mercury, round the Sun, and head outward
again.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> swept past the asteroid at a
distance of some six thousand
miles. Close enough, in very truth&ndash;&ndash;a
minute of flight at our combined speeds
totaling a hundred miles a second. I
had descended to the passenger deck,
where I stood alone at a window, gazing.</p>
<p>The passengers were all gathered to
view the passing little world. I saw,
not far from me, Anita, standing with
her brother; and the giant figure of
Miko with them.</p>
<p>Half an hour since, first with the
naked eye, this wandering little world
had shown itself; it swam slowly past,
began to dwindle behind us. A huge
half moon. A thinner, smaller quadrant.
A tiny crescent, like a silver bar-pin to
adorn some lady&#8217;s breast. And then it
was a dot, a point of light indistinguishable
among the myriad others
hovering in this great black void.</p>
<p>The incident of the passing of the
asteroid was over. I turned from the
deck window. My heart leaped. The
moment for which all day I had been
subconsciously longing was at hand.
Anita was sitting in a deck chair, momentarily
alone. Her gaze was on me
as I looked her way, and she smiled an
invitation for me to join her.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_VII_UNSPOKEN_LOVE' id='CHAPTER_VII_UNSPOKEN_LOVE'></a>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<h4><i>Unspoken Love</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Unspoken</span> love! I think if I had
yielded to the impulse of my
heart, I would have poured out all those
protestations of a lover&#8217;s ecstasy, incongruous
here upon this starlit public
deck, to a girl I hardly knew. I think,
too, she might have received them with
a tender acquiescence. The starlight
was mirrored in her dark eyes. Misty
eyes, with great reaches of unfathomable
space in their depths. Yet I felt
their tenderness.</p>
<p>Unfathomable strangeness of love!
Who am I to write of it, with all the
poets of all the ages striving to express
the unexpressible? A bond, strangely
fashioned by nature, between me and
this little dark-haired Earth beauty.
As though marked by the stars we were
destined to be lovers....</p>
<p>Thus ran the romance of my unspoken
thoughts. But I was sitting
quietly in the deck chair, striving to
regard her gentle beauty impersonally.
And saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;But Miss Prince, why are you and
your brother going to Ferrok-Shahn?
His business&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as I voiced it, I hated myself
for such a question. So nimble is the
human mind that mingled with my
rhapsodies of love was my need for information
of George Prince....</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this is pleasure, not
business, for George.&#8221; It seemed to me
that a shadow crossed her expressive
face. But it was gone in an instant, and
she smiled. &#8220;We have always wanted
to travel. We are alone in the world,
you know&ndash;&ndash;our parents died when we
were children.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I filled</span> in her pause. &#8220;You will
like Mars&ndash;&ndash;so many interesting
things to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded. &#8220;Yes, I understand so.
Our Earth is so much the same all over,
cast all in one mould.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a hundred or two hundred years
ago it was not, Miss Prince. I have
read how the picturesque Orient, differing
from&ndash;&ndash;well, Great-New York, or
London, for instance&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Transportation did that,&#8221; she interrupted
eagerly. &#8220;Made everything the
same&ndash;&ndash;the people all look alike&ndash;&ndash;dress
alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>We discussed it. She had an alert,
eager mind, childlike with its curiosity,
yet strangely matured. And her manner
was na&iuml;vely earnest. Yet this was no
clinging vine, this little Anita Prince.
There was a firmness, a hint of masculine
strength in her chin, and in her
manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were a man, what wonders I
could achieve in this marvelous age!&#8221;
Her sense of humor made her laugh at
herself. &#8220;Easy for a girl to say that,&#8221;
she added.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You have greater wonders to achieve,
Miss Prince,&#8221; I said impulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? What are they?&#8221; She had a
very frank and level gaze, devoid of
coquetry.</p>
<p>My heart was pounding. &#8220;The wonders
of the next generation. A little
son, cast in your own gentle image&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>What madness, this clumsy brash
talk! I choked it off.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">But</span> she took no offense. The dark
rose-petals of her cheeks were
mantled deeper red, but she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221; She turned abruptly
serious. &#8220;I should not laugh. The wonders
of the next generation&ndash;&ndash;conquering
humans marching on....&#8221; Her
voice trailed away. My hand went to
her arm. Strange tingling something
which poets call love! It burned and
surged from my trembling fingers into
the flesh of her forearm.</p>
<p>The starlight glowed in her eyes.
She seemed to be gazing, not at the
silver-lit deck, but away into distant
reaches of the future. And she murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;A little son, cast in my own gentle
image. But with the strength of his
father....&#8221;</p>
<p>Our moment. Just a breathless moment
given us as we sat there with my
hand burning her arm, as though we
both might be seeing ourselves joined
in a new individual&ndash;&ndash;a little son, cast
in his mother&#8217;s gentle image and with
the strength of his father. Our moment,
and then it was over. A step
sounded. I sat back. The giant gray
figure of Miko came past, his great
cloak swaying, with his clanking sword-ornament
beneath it. His bullet head,
with its close-clipped hair, was hatless.
He gazed at us, swaggered past, and
turned the deck corner.</p>
<p>Our moment was gone. Anita said
conventionally, &#8220;It has been pleasant
to talk with you, Mr. Haljan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll have many more,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Ten days&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think we&#8217;ll reach Ferrok-Shahn
on schedule?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I think so.... As I was saying,
Miss Prince, you&#8217;ll enjoy Mars. A
strange, aggressively forward-looking
people.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">An</span> oppression seemed on her. She
stirred in her chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are,&#8221; she said vaguely.
&#8220;My brother and I know many Martians
in Great-New York.&#8221; She checked herself
abruptly. Was she sorry she had
said that? It seemed so.</p>
<p>Miko was coming back. He stopped
this time before us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your brother would see you, Anita.
He sent me to bring you to his room.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glance he shot me had a touch
of insolence. I stood up, and he towered
a head over me.</p>
<p>Anita said, &#8220;Oh yes. I&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>
<p>I bowed. &#8220;I will see you again, Miss
Prince. I thank you for a pleasant half-hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Martian led her away. Her little
figure was like a child with a giant. It
seemed, as they passed the length of
the deck with me staring after them,
that he took her arm roughly. And that
she shrank from him in fear.</p>
<p>And they did not go inside. As
though to show me that he had merely
taken her from me, he stopped at a
distant deck window and stood talking
to her. Once he picked her up as one
would pick up a child to show it some
distant object through the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little son with the strength of his
father....&#8221; Her words echoed in my
mind. Was Anita afraid of this Martian&#8217;s
wooing? Yet held to him by some
power he might have over her brother?
The vagrant thought struck me.</p>
<p>Was it that?</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_VIII_A_SCREAM_IN_THE_NIGHT' id='CHAPTER_VIII_A_SCREAM_IN_THE_NIGHT'></a>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h4><i>A Scream in the Night</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> kept, on the Planetara, always
the time and routine of
our port of departure. The rest of that
afternoon and evening were a blank
of confusion to me. Anita&#8217;s words; the
touch of my hand upon her arm; that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
vast realm of what might be for us,
like a glimpse of a magic land of happiness
which I had seen in her eyes,
and perhaps she had seen in mine&ndash;&ndash;all
this surged within me.</p>
<p>I wandered about the vessel. I was
not hungry. I did not go to the dining
salon for dinner. I carried Johnson
food and water to his cage; and sat,
with my heat-cylinder upon him, listening
to his threats of what would happen
when he could complain to the
Line&#8217;s higher officials.</p>
<p>But what was Johnson doing carrying
a plan of the ship&#8217;s control rooms
in his pockets? And worse: How had
he dared open Snap&#8217;s box in the helio-room
and abstract the code pass-words
for this voyage? Without them we
would be an outlawed vessel, subject
to arrest if any patrol hailed us. Had
Johnson been planning to sell those
pass-words to Miko? I thought so. I
tried to get the confession out of him,
but could not.</p>
<p>I had a brief consultation with Captain
Carter. He was genuinely apprehensive
now. The Planetara carried no
long-range guns, and very few side-arms.
A half-dozen of the heat-ray
hand projectors; a few old-fashioned
weapons of explosion-rifles and automatic
revolvers. And hand projectors
with the new Benson curve-light. We
had models of this for curved vision,
so that one might see around a corner,
so to speak. And with them, we could
project the heat-ray in a curve as well.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> weapons were all in Carter&#8217;s
chart-room, save the few we officers
always carried. Carter was apprehensive,
but of what he could not
say. He had not thought that our plan
to stop at the Moon for treasure could
affect this outward voyage. Any danger
would be upon the way back, when
the Planetara would be adequately
guarded with long-range electronic
guns, and manned with police-soldiers.</p>
<p>But now we were practically defenseless....</p>
<p>I had a moment with Venza, but she
had nothing new to communicate to me.</p>
<p>And for half an hour I chatted with
George Prince. He seemed a gay,
pleasant young man. I could almost
have fancied I liked him. Or was it
because he was Anita&#8217;s brother? He
told me how he looked forward to
traveling with her on Mars. No, he had
never been there before, he said.</p>
<p>He had a measure of Anita&#8217;s earnest
na&iuml;ve personality. Or was he a very
clever scoundrel, with irony lurking in
his soft voice, and a chuckle that he
could so befool me?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk again, Haljan. You interest
me&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve enjoyed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sauntered away from me, joining
the saturnine Ob Hahn, with whom
presently I heard him discussing religion.</p>
<p>The arrest of Johnson had caused
considerable comment among the passengers.
A few had seen me drag him
forward to the cage. The incident had
been the subject of passenger discussion
all afternoon. Captain Carter had
posted a notice to the effect that Johnson&#8217;s
accounts had been found in serious
error, and that Dr. Frank for this
voyage would act in his stead.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It</span> was near midnight when Snap and
I closed and sealed the helio-room
and started for the chart-room, where
we were to meet with Captain Carter
and the other officers. The passengers
had nearly all retired. A game was in
progress in the smoking room, but the
deck was almost deserted.</p>
<p>Snap and I were passing along one
of the interior corridors. The stateroom
doors, with the illumined names
of the passengers, were all closed. The
metal grid of the floor echoed our footsteps.
Snap was in advance of me. His
body suddenly rose in the air. He went
like a balloon to the ceiling, struck it
gently, and all in a heap came floating
down and landed on the floor!</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the infernal!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was laughing as he picked himself
up. But it was a brief laugh. We
knew what had happened: the artificial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
gravity-controls in the base of the ship,
which by magnetic force gave us normality
aboard, were being tampered
with! For just this instant, this particular
small section of this corridor
had been cut off. The slight bulk of the
Planetara, floating in space, had no appreciable
gravity pull on Snap&#8217;s body,
and the impulse of his step as he came
to the unmagnetized area of the corridor
had thrown him to the ceiling.
The area was normal now. Snap and I
tested it gingerly.</p>
<p>He gripped me. &#8220;That never went
wrong by accident, Gregg! Someone
down there&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> rushed to the nearest descending
ladder. In the deserted
lower room the bank of dials stood
neglected. A score of dials and switches
were here, governing the magnetism of
different areas of the ship. There
should have been a night operator, but
he was gone.</p>
<p>Then we saw him lying nearby,
sprawled face down on the floor! In
the silence and dim lurid glow of the
fluorescent tubes, we stood holding our
breaths, peering and listening. No one
here.</p>
<p>The guard was not dead. He lay unconscious
from a blow on the head. A
brawny fellow. We had him revived in
a few moments. A broadcast flash of
the call-buzz brought Dr. Frank in
haste from the chart-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>We pointed at the unconscious man.
&#8220;Someone was here,&#8221; I said hastily.
&#8220;Experimenting with the magnetic
switches. Evidently unfamiliar with
them&ndash;&ndash;pulling one or another to test
their workings and so see the reactions
on the dials.&#8221;</p>
<p>We told him what had happened to
Snap in the upper corridor.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank revived the guard in a moment.
He was no worse off for the
episode, save a lump on his head, and
a nasty headache.</p>
<p>But he had little to tell us. He had
heard a step. Saw nothing&ndash;&ndash;and then
had been struck on the head, by some
invisible assailant.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> left him nursing his head,
sitting belligerent at his post.
Armed now with my heat-ray cylinder
which I loaned him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange doings this voyage,&#8221; he told
us. &#8220;All the crew knows it&ndash;&ndash;all been
talkin&#8217; about it. I stick it out now, but
when we get back home I&#8217;m done with
this star travelin&#8217;. I belong on the sea
anyway. A good old freighter is all
right for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>We hurried back to the upper level.
We would indeed have to plan something
at this chart-room conference.
This was the first tangible attack our
adversaries had made.</p>
<p>We were on the passenger deck
headed for the chart-room when all
three of us stopped short, frozen with
horror. Through the silent passenger
quarters a scream rang out! A girl&#8217;s
shuddering, gasping scream. Terror in
it. Horror. Or a scream of agony. In
the silence of the dully vibrating ship
it was utterly horrible. It lasted an
instant&ndash;&ndash;a single long scream; then was
abruptly stilled.</p>
<p>And with blood pounding my temples
and rushing like ice through my veins,
I recognized it.</p>
<p>Anita!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h4><i>The Murder in A 22</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">G</span><span class="dcap">ood God,</span> what was that?&#8221; Dr.
Frank&#8217;s face had gone white in
the starlight. Snap stood like a statue
of horror.</p>
<p>The deck here was patched as always,
silver radiance from the deck
ports. The empty deck chairs stood
about. The scream was stilled, but now
we heard a commotion inside&ndash;&ndash;the rasp
of opening cabin doors; questions from
frightened passengers; the scurry of
feet.</p>
<p>I found my voice. &#8220;Anita! Anita
Prince!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; shouted Snap. &#8220;Was it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
the Prince girl? I thought so too! In
her stateroom, A&nbsp;22!&#8221; He was dashing
for the lounge archway.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank and I followed. I realized
that we passed the deck door and window
of A&nbsp;22. But they were dark, and
evidently sealed on the inside. The dim
lounge was in a turmoil; passengers
standing at their cabin doors. I heard
Sir Arthur Coniston:</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, what was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there,&#8221; said another man.
&#8220;Come back inside, Martha.&#8221; He shoved
his wife back. &#8220;Mr. Haljan!&#8221; He
plucked at me as I went past.</p>
<p>I shouted, &#8220;Go back to your rooms!
We want order here&ndash;&ndash;keep back!&#8221;</p>
<p>We came to the twin doors of A&nbsp;22
and A&nbsp;20. Both were closed. Dr. Frank
was in advance of Snap and me. He
paused at the sound of Captain Carter&#8217;s
voice behind us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it from in there? Wait a moment!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter dashed up; he had a large
heat-ray projector in his hand. He
shoved us aside. &#8220;Let me in first. Is the
door sealed? Gregg, keep those passengers
back!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> door was not sealed. Carter
burst into the room. I heard him
gasp, &#8220;Good God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap and I shoved back three or four
crowding passengers, and in that instant
Dr. Frank had been in the room
and out again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been an accident! Get back,
Gregg! Snap, help him keep the crowd
away.&#8221; He shoved me forcibly.</p>
<p>From within, Carter was shouting,
&#8220;Keep them out! Where are you,
Frank? Come back here! Send a flash
for Balch&ndash;&ndash;I want Balch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Frank went back into the room
and banged the cabin door upon Snap
and me. I was unarmed&ndash;&ndash;I had loaned
my cylinder to the guard in the lower
corridor. Weapon in hand, Snap forced
the panic-stricken passengers back to
their rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right! An accident! Miss
Prince is hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap reassured them glibly; but he
knew no more about it than I. Moa,
with a night-robe drawn tight around
her thin, tall figure, edged up to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened, Set Haljan?&#8221;</p>
<p>I gazed around for her brother Miko,
but did not see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;An accident,&#8221; I said shortly. &#8220;Go
back to your room. Captain&#8217;s orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>She eyed me and then retreated. Snap
was threatening everybody with his
cylinder. Balch dashed up. &#8220;What in
the hell? Where&#8217;s Carter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In there.&#8221; I pounded on A&nbsp;22. It
opened cautiously. I could see only
Carter, but I heard the murmuring
voice of Dr. Frank through the interior
connecting door to A&nbsp;20.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> captain rasped, &#8220;Get out, Haljan!
Oh, is that you, Balch? Come
in.&#8221; He admitted the older officer and
slammed the door again upon me. And
immediately reopened it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg, keep the passengers quiet.
Tell them everything&#8217;s all right. Miss
Prince got frightened, that&#8217;s all. Then
go up to the turret. Tell Blackstone
what&#8217;s happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happened,&#8221;
I protested miserably.</p>
<p>Carter was grim and white. He whispered,
&#8220;I think it may turn out to be
murder, Gregg! No, not dead yet&ndash;&ndash;Dr.
Frank is trying&ndash;&ndash;Don&#8217;t stand there like
an ass, man! Get to the turret! Verify
our trajectory&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;wait&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain was almost incoherent.
&#8220;Wait a minute, I don&#8217;t mean that! Tell
Snap to watch his helio-room. Gregg,
you and Blackstone stay in the chart-room.
Arm yourselves and guard our
weapons. By God, this murderer, whoever
he is&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I stammered, &#8220;If&ndash;&ndash;if she dies&ndash;&ndash;will
you flash us word?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at me strangely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
there presently, Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slammed the door upon me.</p>
<p>I followed his orders, but it was like
a dream of horror. The turmoil of the
ship gradually quieted. Snap went to
the helio-room; Blackstone and I sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
in the tiny steel chart-room. How much
time passed, I do not know. I was confused.
Anita hurt! She might die....
Murdered.... But why? By whom?
Had George Prince been in his own
room when the attack came? I thought
now I recalled hearing the low murmur
of his voice in there with Dr. Frank
and Carter.</p>
<p>Where was Miko? It stabbed at me.
I had not seen him among the passengers
in the lounge.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Carter</span> came into the chart-room.
&#8220;Gregg, you get to bed&ndash;&ndash;you look
like a ghost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not dead&ndash;&ndash;she may live. Dr.
Frank and her brother are with her.
They&#8217;re doing all they can.&#8221; He told
us what had happened. Anita and
George Prince had both been asleep,
each in their respective rooms. Someone
unknown had opened Anita&#8217;s corridor
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it sealed?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But the intruder opened it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Burst it? I didn&#8217;t think it was
broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t broken. The assailant
opened it somehow, and assaulted Miss
Prince&ndash;&ndash;shot her in the chest with a
heat-ray. Her left lung.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is conscious?&#8221; Balch demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But she did not see who did it.
Nor did Prince. Her scream awakened
him, but the intruder evidently fled out
the corridor door of A&nbsp;22, the way he
entered.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stood weak and shaken at the chart-room
entrance. &#8220;A little son, cast in the
gentle image of his mother. But with
the strength of his father....&#8221; But
Anita&ndash;&ndash;dying, perhaps; and all my
dreams were fading into a memory of
what might have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to bed, Gregg&ndash;&ndash;we don&#8217;t
need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was glad enough to get away. I
would lie down for an hour, and then
go to Anita&#8217;s stateroom. I&#8217;d demand
that Dr. Frank let me see her, if only
for a moment.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I went</span> to the stern deck-space
where my cubby was located. My
mind was confused, but some instinct
within me made me verify the seals of
my door and window. They were intact.
I entered cautiously, switched on the
dimmer of the tube-lights, and searched
the room. It had only a bunk, my tiny
desk, a chair and clothes robe.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of any intruder
here. I set my door and window
alarm. Then I audiphoned to the helio-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him about Anita. Carter cut
in on us from the chart-room. &#8220;Stop
that, you fools!&#8221;</p>
<p>We cut off. Fully dressed, I flung
myself on my bed. Anita might die....</p>
<p>I must have fallen into a tortured
sleep. I was awakened by the sound of
my alarm buzzer. Someone was tampering
with my door! Then the buzzer
ceased; the marauder outside must
have found a way of silencing it. But
it had done its work&ndash;&ndash;awakened me.</p>
<p>I had switched off the light; my
cubby was Stygian dark. A heat-cylinder
was in the bunk-bracket over my
head; I searched for it, pried it loose
softly.</p>
<p>I was fully awake. Alert. I could
hear a faint sizzling&ndash;&ndash;someone outside
trying to unseal the door. In the darkness,
cylinder in hand, I crept from the
bunk. Crouched at the door. This time
I would capture or kill this night
prowler.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> sizzling was faintly audible.
My door-seal was breaking. Upon
impulse I reached for the door, jerked
it open.</p>
<p>No one there! The starlit segment of
deck was empty. But I had leaped, and
I struck a solid body, crouching in the
doorway. A giant man. Miko!</p>
<p>His electronized metallic robe burned
my hands. I lunged against him&ndash;&ndash;I was
almost as surprised as he. I shot, but
the stab of heat evidently missed him.</p>
<p>The shock of my encounter close-circuited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
his robe; he materialized in
the starlight. A brief, savage encounter.
He struck the weapon from my hand.
He had dropped his hydrogen torch,
and tried to grip me. But I twisted
away from his hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, Gregg Haljan! I only
want to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without warning, a stab of radiance
shot from a weapon in his hand. It
caught me. Ran like ice through my
veins. Seized and numbed my limbs.</p>
<p>I fell helpless to the deck. Nerves
and muscles paralyzed. My tongue was
thick and inert. I could not speak, nor
move. But I could see Miko bending
over me. And hear him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to kill you, Haljan. We
need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gathered me up like a bundle in
his huge arms; carried me swiftly
across the deserted deck.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s helio-room in the network
under the dome was diagonally overhead.
A white actinic light shot from it&ndash;&ndash;caught
us, bathed us. Snap had been
awake; had heard the slight commotion
of our encounter.</p>
<p>His voice rang shrilly: &#8220;Stop! I&#8217;ll
shoot!&#8221; His warning siren rang out to
arouse the ship. His spotlight clung to
us.</p>
<p>Miko ran with me a few steps. Then
he cursed and dropped me, fled away.
I fell like a sack of carbide to the deck.
My senses faded into blackness....</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">H</span><span class="dcap">e&#8217;s</span> all right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was in the chart-room, with
Captain Carter, Snap and Dr. Frank
bending over me. The surgeon said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you speak now, Gregg?&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried it. My tongue was thick, but
it would move. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was soon revived. I sat up, with
Dr. Frank vigorously rubbing me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right.&#8221; I told them what had
happened.</p>
<p>Captain Carter said abruptly, &#8220;Yes,
we know that. And it was Miko also
who killed Anita Prince. She told us
before she died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Died!...&#8221; I leaped to my feet.
&#8220;She ... died....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Gregg. An hour ago, Miko got
into her stateroom and tried to force
his love on her. She repulsed him&ndash;&ndash;he
killed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>It struck me blank. And then with a
rush came the thought, &#8220;He says Miko
killed her....&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard myself stammering, &#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;why
we must get him!&#8221; I gathered my
wits; a surge of hate swept me; a wild
desire for vengeance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, by God, where is he? Why
don&#8217;t you go get him? I&#8217;ll get him&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll
kill him, I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, Gregg!&#8221; Dr. Frank gripped
me.</p>
<p>The captain said gently, &#8220;We know
how you feel, Gregg. She told us before
she died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring him in here to you! But
I&#8217;ll kill him, I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t, lad. You&#8217;re hysterical
now. We don&#8217;t want him killed, not attacked
even. Not yet. We&#8217;ll explain
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat me down, calming me.</p>
<p>Anita dead. The door of the shining
garden was closed. A brief glimpse,
given to me and to her of what might
have been. And now she was dead....</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<h4><i>A Speck of Human Earth-dust, Falling Free....</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I had</span> not been able at first to understand
why Captain Carter wanted
Miko left at liberty. Within me there
was that cry of vengeance, as though
to strike Miko down would somehow
lessen my own grief at Anita&#8217;s loss.
Whatever Carter&#8217;s purpose, Snap had
not known it. But Balch and Dr. Frank
were in the captain&#8217;s confidence&ndash;&ndash;all
three of them working on some plan of
action. Snap and I argued it, and
thought we could fathom it; and in
spite of my desire to kill Miko, the
thing looked reasonable.</p>
<p>It was obvious that at least two of
our passengers were plotting with Miko
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
and George Prince; trying during this
voyage to learn what they could about
Grantline&#8217;s activities on the Moon;
scheming doubtless to seize the treasure
when the Planetara stopped at the Moon
on the return voyage. I thought I could
name those masquerading passengers.
Ob Hahn, supposedly a Venus Mystic.
And Rance Rankin, who called himself
an American magician. Those two,
Snap and I agreed, seemed most suspicious.
And there was the purser.</p>
<p>With my hysteria still on me, I sat
for a time on the deck outside the
chart-room with Snap. Then Carter
summoned us back, and we sat listening
while he, Balch and Dr. Frank
went on with their conference. Listening
to them I could not but agree that
our best plan was to secure evidence
which would incriminate all who were
concerned in the plot. Miko, we were
convinced, had been the Martian who
followed Snap and me from Halsey&#8217;s
office in Great-New York. George
Prince had doubtless been the invisible
eavesdropper outside the helio-room.
He knew, and had told the others, that
Grantline had found radium-ore on the
Moon&ndash;&ndash;that the Planetara would stop
there on the way home.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">But</span> we could not incarcerate
George Prince for being an eavesdropper.
Nor had we the faintest tangible
evidence against Ob Hahn or Rance
Rankin. And even the purser would
probably be released by the Interplanetary
Court of Ferrok-Shahn when it
heard our evidence.</p>
<p>There was only Miko. We could arrest
him for the murder of Anita. But
the others would be put on their guard.
It was Carter&#8217;s idea to let Miko remain
at liberty for a time and see if we
could not identify and incriminate his
fellows. The murder of Anita obviously
had nothing to do with any plot against
the Grantline Moon treasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Balch, &#8220;there
might be&ndash;&ndash;probably are&ndash;&ndash;huge Martian
interests concerned in this thing. These
men here aboard are only emissaries,
making this voyage to learn what they
can. When they get to Ferrok-Shahn
they&#8217;ll make their report, and then we&#8217;ll
have a real danger on our hands. Why,
an outlaw ship could be launched from
Ferrok-Shahn that would beat us back
to the Moon&ndash;&ndash;and Grantline is entirely
without warning of any danger!&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed obvious. Unscrupulous,
moneyed criminals in Ferrok-Shahn
would be dangerous indeed, once these
details of Grantline were given them.
And so now it was decided that in the
remaining nine days of our outward
voyage, we would attempt to secure
enough evidence to arrest all these
plotters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have them all in the cage when
we land,&#8221; Carter declared grimly.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll make no report to their principals.
The thing will end, be stamped
out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, the futile plans of men!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Yet</span> we thought it practical. We
were all doubly armed now. Explosive
bullet-projectors and the heat-ray
cylinders. And we had several
eavesdropping microphones which we
planned to use whenever occasion offered.</p>
<p>It was now, Earth Eastern Time,
A.&nbsp;M. Twenty-eight hours only of this
eventful voyage were passed. The
Planetara was some six million miles
from the Earth; it blazed behind us,
a tremendous giant.</p>
<p>The body of Anita was being made
ready for burial. George Prince was
still in his stateroom. Glutz, effeminate
little hairdresser, who waxed rich acting
as beauty doctor for the women
passengers, and who in his youth had
been an undertaker, had gone with Dr.
Frank to prepare the body.</p>
<p>Gruesome details. I tried not to
think of them. I sat, numbed, in the
chart-room.</p>
<p>An astronomical burial&ndash;&ndash;there was
little precedent for it. I dragged myself
to the stern deck-space where, at
five A.&nbsp;M., the ceremony took place.
Most of the passengers were asleep,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
unaware of all this&ndash;&ndash;which was why
Carter hastened it.</p>
<p>We were a solemn little group,
gathered there in the checkered starlight
with the great vault of the
heavens around us. A dismantled electronic
projector&ndash;&ndash;necessary when a
long-range gun was mounted&ndash;&ndash;had been
rigged up in one of the deck ports.</p>
<p>They brought out the body. I stood
apart, gazing reluctantly at the small
bundle, wrapped like a mummy in a
dark metallic screen-cloth. A patch of
black silk rested over her face.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Four</span> cabin stewards carried her.
And beside her walked George
Prince. A long black robe covered him,
but his head was bare. And suddenly
he reminded me of the ancient play-character
of Hamlet. His black, wavy
hair; his finely chiseled, pallid face,
set now in a stern, patrician cast. And
staring, I realized that however much
of a villain this man not yet thirty
might be, at this instant, walking beside
the body of his dead sister, he was
stricken with grief. He loved that
sister with whom he had lived since
childhood; and to see him now, with
his set white face, no one could
doubt it.</p>
<p>The little procession stopped in a
patch of starlight by the port. They
rested the body on a bank of chairs.
The black-robed Chaplain, roused from
his bed and still trembling from excitement
of this sudden, inexplicable death
on board, said a brief, solemn little
prayer. An appeal: That the Almighty
Ruler of all these blazing worlds might
guard the soul of this gentle girl whose
mortal remains were now to be returned
to Him.</p>
<p>Ah, if ever God seemed hovering
close, it was now at this instant, on
this starlit deck floating in the black
void of space.</p>
<p>Then Carter for just a moment removed
the black shroud from her face.
I saw her brother gaze silently; saw
him stoop and implant a kiss&ndash;&ndash;and turn
away. I did not want to look, but I
found myself moving slowly forward.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">She</span> lay, so beautiful. Her face,
white and calm and peaceful in
death. My sight blurred. Words
seemed to echo: &#8220;A little son, cast in
the gentle image of his mother....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, Gregg!&#8221; Snap was whispering
to me. He had his arm around me.
&#8220;Come on away!&#8221;</p>
<p>They tied the shroud over her face.
I did not see them as they put her body
in the tube, sent it through the exhaust-chamber,
and dropped it.</p>
<p>But a moment later I saw it&ndash;&ndash;a small
black oblong bundle&ndash;&ndash;hovering beside
us. It was perhaps a hundred feet
away, circling us. Held by the Planetara&#8217;s
bulk, it had momentarily become
our satellite. It swung around us like
a moon. Gruesome satellite, by nature&#8217;s
laws forever to follow us.</p>
<p>Then from another tube at the bow,
Blackstone operated a small Zed-co-ray
projector. Its dull light caught the
floating bundle, neutralizing its metallic
wrappings.</p>
<p>It swung off at a tangent. Speeding.
Falling free in the dome of the heavens.
A rotating black oblong. But in a moment
distance dwindled it to a speck.
A dull silver dot with the sunlight on
it. A speck of human Earth-dust, falling
free....</p>
<p>It vanished. Anita&ndash;&ndash;gone. In my
heart was an echo of the prayer that
the Almighty might watch over her
and guard her always....</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<h4><i>The Electrical Eavesdropper</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I turned</span> from the deck. Miko
was near me! So he had dared to
show himself here among us! But I
realized that he could not be aware we
knew he was the murderer. George
Prince had been asleep, had not seen
Miko with Anita. Miko, with impulsive
rage, had shot the girl and escaped.
No doubt now he was cursing
himself for having done it. And he
could very well assume that Anita had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
died without regaining consciousness
to tell who had killed her.</p>
<p>He gazed at me now, here on the
deck. I thought for an instant he was
coming over to talk to me. Though
he probably considered he was not suspected
of the murder of Anita, he realized,
of course, that his attack on me
was known; he must have wondered
what action Captain Carter would take.</p>
<p>But he did not approach me; he
moved away, and went inside. Moa
had been near him; and as though by
pre-arrangement with him she now accosted
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you, Set Haljan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt an instinctive aversion for this
Martian girl. Yet she was not unattractive.
Over six feet tall, straight
and slim. Sleek blond hair. Rather a
handsome face. Not gray, like the
burly Miko, but pink and white. Stern-lipped,
yet feminine, too. She was
smiling gravely now. Her blue eyes
regarded me keenly. She said gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;A sad occurrence, Gregg Haljan.
And mysterious. I would not question
you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all you have to say?&#8221; I demanded,
when she paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You are a handsome man, Gregg&ndash;&ndash;attractive
to women&ndash;&ndash;to any Martian
woman.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">She</span> said it impulsively. Admiration
for me was on her face, in her
eyes&ndash;&ndash;a man cannot miss it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, I would be your friend. My
brother Miko is so sorry about what
happened between you and him this
morning. He only wanted to talk to
you, and he came to your cubby
door&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a torch to break its seal,&#8221; I interjected.</p>
<p>She waved that away. &#8220;He was afraid
you would not admit him. He told you
he would not hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so he struck me with one of
your cursed Martian paralyzing rays!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is sorry....&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed gauging me, trying, no
doubt, to find out what reprisal would
be taken against her brother. I felt
sure that Moa was as active as a man
in any plan that was under way to capture
the Grantline treasure. Miko, with
his ungovernable temper, was doing
things that put their plans in jeopardy.</p>
<p>I demanded abruptly, &#8220;What did
your brother want to talk to me about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me,&#8221; she said surprisingly. &#8220;I sent
him. A Martian girl goes after what
she wants. Did you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She swung on her heel and left me. I
puzzled over it. Was that why Miko
had struck me down, and was carrying
me off? Was my accursed masculine
beauty so attractive to this Martian
girl? I did not think so. I could not
believe that all these incidents were so
unrelated to what I knew was the main
undercurrent. They wanted me, had
tried to capture me. For something else
than because Moa liked my looks....</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dr. Frank</span> found me mooning
alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to bed, Gregg! You look awful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Snap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He was here a while
ago.&#8221; I had not seen him since the
burial of Anita.</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain wants him.&#8221; The surgeon
left me.</p>
<p>Within an hour the morning siren
would arouse the passengers. I was
seated in a secluded corner of the deck,
when George Prince came along. He
went past me, a slight, somber, dark-robed
figure. He had on high, thick
boots. A hood was over his head, but
as he saw me he pushed it back and
dropped down beside me.</p>
<p>But for a moment he did not speak.
His face showed pallid in the pallid
star-gleams.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said you loved her.&#8221; His soft
voice was throaty with emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said it almost against my
will. There seemed a bond springing
between this bereaved brother and me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
He added, so softly I could barely hear
him, &#8220;That makes you, I think, almost
my friend. And you thought you were
my enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I held my answer. An incautious
tongue running under emotion is a
dangerous thing. And I was sure of
nothing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> went on, &#8220;Almost my friend.
Because&ndash;&ndash;we both loved her, and
she loved us both.&#8221; He was hardly
more than whispering. &#8220;And there is
aboard&ndash;&ndash;one whom we both hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miko!&#8221; It burst from me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But do not say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another silence fell between us. He
brushed back the black curls from his
forehead. And his dark eyes searched
mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you an eavesdropping microphone,
Haljan?&#8221;</p>
<p>I hesitated. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking....&#8221; He leaned closer
toward me. &#8220;If, in half an hour, you
could use it upon Miko&#8217;s cabin&ndash;&ndash;I
would rather tell you than the captain
or anyone else. The cabin will be insulated,
but I shall find a way of cutting
off that insulation so that you may
hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>So George Prince had turned with
us! The shock of his sister&#8217;s death&ndash;&ndash;himself
allied to her murderer!&ndash;&ndash;had
been too much for him. He was with
us!</p>
<p>Yet his help must be given secretly.
Miko would kill him in an instant if it
became known.</p>
<p>He had been watchful of the deck.
He stood up now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he turned away, I murmured,
&#8220;But I do thank you....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> name Set Miko glowed upon
the small metal door. It was in a
transverse corridor similar to A&nbsp;22. The
corridor was forward of the lounge: it
opened off the small circular library.</p>
<p>The library was unoccupied and unlighted,
dim with only the reflected
lights from the nearby passages. I
crouched behind a cylinder-case. The
door of Miko&#8217;s room was in sight, being
some thirty feet away from me.</p>
<p>I waited perhaps five minutes. No
one entered. Then I realized that
doubtless the conspirators were already
there. I set my tiny eavesdropper
on the library floor beside me;
connected its little battery; <a name='TC_2'></a><ins title="Was 'focussed'">focused</ins>
its projector. Was Miko&#8217;s room insulated?
I could not tell. There was a
small ventilating grid above the door.
Across its opening, if the room were
insulated, a blue sheen of radiance
would be showing. And there would
be a faint hum. But from this distance
I could not see or hear such details, and
I was afraid to approach closer. Once
in the transverse corridor, I would have
no place to hide, no way of escape; if
anyone approached Miko&#8217;s door, I
would be discovered.</p>
<p>I threw the current into my little
apparatus. I prayed, if it met interference,
that the slight sound would
pass unnoticed. George Prince had
said he would make opportunity to disconnect
the room&#8217;s insulation. He had
evidently done so. I picked up the interior
sounds at once; my headphone
vibrated with them. And with trembling
fingers on the little dial between
my knees as I crouched in the darkness
behind the cylinder-case, I <a name='TC_14'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'syncronized'">synchronized</ins>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson is a fool.&#8221; It was Miko&#8217;s
voice. &#8220;We must have the pass-words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He got them from the helio-room.&#8221;
A man&#8217;s voice; I puzzled over it at
first, then recognized it. Rance Rankin.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Miko</span> said, &#8220;He is a fool. Walking
around this ship as though
with letters blazoned on his forehead&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Watch
me&ndash;&ndash;I need watching&ndash;&ndash;&#8217; Hah!
No wonder they apprehended him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was George Prince in there? Rankin&#8217;s
voice said: &#8220;He would have
turned the papers over to us. I would
not blame him too much. What
harm&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll release him,&#8221; Miko declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
&#8220;What harm? That braying ass did us
plenty of harm. He has lost the pass-words.
Better he had left them in the
helio-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moa was in the room. Her voice
said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to have them. The
Planetara, upon such an important voyage
as this, may be watched. How do
we know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, no doubt,&#8221; Rankin said quietly.
&#8220;We ought to have the pass-words.
When we are in control of this
ship....&#8221;</p>
<p>It sent a shiver through me. Were
they planning to try and seize the
Planetara? Now? It seemed so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson undoubtedly memorized
them,&#8221; Moa was saying. &#8220;When we get
him out&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahn is to do that, at the signal.&#8221;
Miko added, &#8220;George could do it better,
perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I heard George Prince for
the first time. He murmured, &#8220;I will
try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need,&#8221; said Miko. &#8220;I praise
where praise is deserved. And I have
little praise for you now, George!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not see what happened. A
look, perhaps, which Prince could not
avoid giving this man he had come to
hate. Miko doubtless saw it, and the
Martian&#8217;s hot anger <a name='TC_15'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Removed extra quote after leaped">leaped.</ins></p>
<p>Rankin said hurriedly, &#8220;Stop that!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Moa: &#8220;Let him alone! Sit down,
you fool!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I could</span> hear the sound of a scuffle.
A blow&ndash;&ndash;a cry, half suppressed,
from George Prince.</p>
<p>Then Miko: &#8220;I will not hurt him.
Craven coward! Look at him! Hating
me&ndash;&ndash;frightened!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could fancy George Prince sitting
there with murder in his heart, and
Miko taunting him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hates me now, because I shot his
sister!&#8221;</p>
<p>Moa: &#8220;Hush!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not! Why should I not say
it? I will tell you something else,
George Prince. It was not Anita I shot
at, but you! I meant nothing for her,
but love. If you had not interfered&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was different from what we had
figured. George Prince had come in
from his own room, had tried to rescue
his sister, and in the scuffle, Anita had
taken the shot intended for George.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not even know I had hit her,&#8221;
Miko was saying. &#8220;Not until I heard
she was dead.&#8221; He added sardonically,
&#8220;I hoped it was you I had hit, George.
And I will tell you this: You hate me
no more than I hate you. If it were
not for your knowledge of radium
ores&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this to be a personal wrangle?&#8221;
Rankin interrupted. &#8220;I thought we
were here to plan&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is planned,&#8221; Miko said shortly. &#8220;I
give orders, I do not plan. I am waiting
now for the moment&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> checked himself. Moa said,
&#8220;Does Rankin understand that
no harm is to come to Gregg Haljan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rankin. &#8220;And Dean. We
need them, of course. But you cannot
make Dean send messages if he refuses,
nor make Haljan navigate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know enough to check on them,&#8221;
Miko said grimly. &#8220;They will not fool
me. And they will obey me, have no
fear. A little touch of sulphuric&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
His laugh was gruesome. &#8220;It makes
the most stubborn very willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Moa, &#8220;we had Haljan
safely hidden. If he is hurt&ndash;&ndash;killed&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>So that was why Miko had tried to
capture me? To keep me safe so that
I might navigate the ship.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I should get
Carter at once. A plot to seize the
Planetara? But when?</p>
<p>I froze with startled horror.</p>
<p>The diaphragms at my ears rang with
Miko&#8217;s words: &#8220;I have set the time for
now! In two minutes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to startle both Rankin and
George Prince almost as much as I.
Both exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No? Why not? Everyone is at his
post!&#8221;</p>
<p>Prince repeated: &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>And Rankin: &#8220;But can we trust
them? The stewards&ndash;&ndash;the crew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight of them are our own men!
You didn&#8217;t know that, Rankin? They&#8217;ve
been aboard the Planetara for several
voyages. Oh, this is no quickly-planned
affair, even though we let you
in on it so recently. You and Johnson.
By God!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I crouched</span> tense. There was a
commotion in the stateroom. Miko
had discovered that his insulation was
cut off! He had evidently leaped to his
feet; I heard a chair overturn. And
the Martian&#8217;s roar: &#8220;It&#8217;s off! Did you
do that, Prince? By God, if I
thought&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>My apparatus went suddenly dead as
Miko flung on his insulation. I lost my
wits in the confusion; I should have
instantly taken off my vibrations.
There was interference; it showed in
the dark space of the ventilator grid
over Miko&#8217;s doorway; a snapping in the
air there, a swirl of sparks.</p>
<p>I heard with my unaided ears Miko&#8217;s
roar over his insulation: &#8220;By God,
they&#8217;re listening!&#8221;</p>
<p>The scream of a hand-siren sounded
from his stateroom. It rang over the
ship. His signal! I heard it answered
from some distant point. And then a
shot; a commotion in the lower corridors....</p>
<p>The attack upon the Planetara had
started!</p>
<p>I was on my feet. The shouts of
startled passengers sounded, a turmoil
beginning everywhere.</p>
<p>I stood momentarily transfixed. The
door of Miko&#8217;s stateroom burst open.
He stood there, with Moa, Rankin and
George Prince crowding behind him.</p>
<p>He saw me. &#8220;You, Gregg Haljan!&#8221;</p>
<p>He came leaping at me.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_XII_THE_WEIGHTLESS_COMBAT' id='CHAPTER_XII_THE_WEIGHTLESS_COMBAT'></a>
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<h4><i>The Weightless Combat</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I was</span> taken wholly by surprise.
There was an instant when I stood
numbed, fumbling for a weapon at my
belt, undecided whether to run or stand
my ground. Miko was no more than
twenty feet from me. He checked his
forward rush. The light from an overhead
tube was on him; I saw in his
hand the cylinder projector of his
paralyzing ray.</p>
<p>I plucked my heat-cylinder from my
belt, and fired without taking aim. My
tiny heat-beam flashed. I must have
grazed Miko&#8217;s hand. His roar of anger
and pain rang out over the turmoil. He
dropped his weapon; then stooped to
pick it up. But Moa forestalled him.
She leaped and seized it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful! Fool&ndash;&ndash;you promised not
to hurt him!&#8221;</p>
<p>A confusion of swift action. Rankin
had turned and darted away. I saw
George Prince stumbling half in front
of the struggling Miko and Moa. And
I heard footsteps beside me; a hand
gripped me, jerked at me.</p>
<p>Over the turmoil Prince&#8217;s voice
sounded: &#8220;Gregg&ndash;&ndash;Haljan!&#8221;</p>
<p>I recall I had the impression that
Prince was frightened; he had half
fallen in front of Miko. And there was
Miko&#8217;s voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go of me!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Moa: &#8220;Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Balch gripping me. &#8220;Gregg!
This way&ndash;&ndash;run! Get out of here!
He&#8217;ll kill you with that ray&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Miko&#8217;s ray flashed, but George Prince
had knocked at his arm. I did not dare
fire again. Prince was in the way.
Balch, who was unarmed, shoved me
violently back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg&ndash;&ndash;the chart-room!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I turned</span> and ran, with Balch after
me. Prince had fallen, or been
felled by Miko. A flash followed me.
Miko&#8217;s weapon, but again it missed. He
did not pursue me; he ran the other
way, through the port-side door of the
library.</p>
<p>Balch and I found ourselves in the
lounge. Shouting, frightened passengers
were everywhere. The place was
in wild confusion, the whole ship ringing
now with shouts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To the chart-room, Gregg!&#8221;</p>
<p>I called to the passengers: &#8220;Get back
to your rooms!&#8221;</p>
<p>I followed Balch. We ran through
the archway to the deck. In the starlight
I saw figures scurrying aft, but
none were near us. The deck forward
was dim with heavy shadows. The oval
window and door of the chart-room
were blue-yellow from the tube-lights
inside. No one seemed on the deck
there; and then, as we approached, I
saw, further forward in the bow, the
trap-door to the cage standing open.
Johnson had been released.</p>
<p>From one of the chart-room windows
a heat-ray sizzled. It barely missed us.
Balch shouted, &#8220;Carter&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain called, &#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;you, Balch&ndash;&ndash;and
Haljan&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He came out on the deck as we
rushed up. His left arm was dangling
limp.</p>
<p>&#8220;God&ndash;&ndash;this&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He got no further.
From the turret overhead a tiny
search-beam came down and disclosed
us. Blackstone was supposed to be on
duty up there, with a course-master at
the controls. But, glancing up, I saw,
illumined by the turret lights, the figures
of Ob Hahn in his purple-white
robe, and Johnson the purser. And on
the turret balcony, two fallen men&ndash;&ndash;Blackstone
and the course-master.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Johnson</span> was training the spotlight
on us. And Hahn fired a Martian
ray. It struck Balch beside me.
He dropped.</p>
<p>Carter was shouting, &#8220;Inside! Gregg,
get inside!&#8221;</p>
<p>I stopped to raise up Balch. Another
beam came down. A heat-ray this
time. It caught the fallen Balch full
in the chest, piercing him through. The
smell of his burning flesh rose to sicken
me. He was dead. I dropped his body.
Carter shoved me into the chart-room.</p>
<p>In the small, steel-lined room, Carter
and I slid the door closed. We were
alone here. The thing had come so
quickly it had taken Captain Carter,
like us all, wholly unawares. We had
anticipated spying eavesdroppers, but
not this open brigandage. No more than
a minute or two had passed since
Miko&#8217;s siren in his stateroom had given
the signal for the attack. Carter had
been in the chart-room. Blackstone was
in the turret. At the outbreak of confusion,
Carter dashed out to see Hahn
releasing Johnson from the cage. From
the forward chart-room window now I
could see where Hahn with a torch had
broken the cage-seal. The torch lay on
the deck. There had been an exchange
of shots; Carter&#8217;s arm was paralyzed;
Johnson and Hahn had escaped.</p>
<p>Carter was as confused as I. There
had simultaneously been an encounter
up in the turret. Blackstone and the
course-master were killed. The lookout
had been shot from his post in the
forward observatory. His body dangled
now, twisted half in and half out
of his window.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> could see several of Miko&#8217;s
men&ndash;&ndash;erstwhile members of our
crew and steward-corps&ndash;&ndash;scurrying
from the turret along the upper bridges
toward the dark and silent helio-room.
Snap was up there. But was he? The
helio-room glowed suddenly with dim
light, but there was no evidence of a
fight there. The fighting seemed mostly
below the deck, down in the hull-corridors.
A blended horror of sounds
came up to us. Screams, shouts, and
the hissing and snapping of ray weapons.
Our crew&ndash;&ndash;such of them as were
loyal&ndash;&ndash;were making a stand down below.
But it was brief. Within a minute
it died away. The passengers, amidships
in the superstructure, were still
shouting. Then above them Miko&#8217;s
roar sounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet! Go in your rooms&ndash;&ndash;you
will not be harmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brigands in these few minutes
were in control of the ship. All but
this little chart-room, where, with most
of the ship&#8217;s weapons, Carter and I
were intrenched.</p>
<p>&#8220;God, Gregg, that this should come
upon us!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></div>
<p>Carter was fumbling with the chart-room
weapons. &#8220;Here, Gregg, help me.
What have you got? Heat-ray? That&#8217;s
all I had ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>It struck me then as I helped him
make the connections that Carter in
this crisis was at best an inefficient
commander. His red face had gone
splotchy purple; his hands were trembling.
Skilled as captain of a peaceful
liner, he was at a loss now. Nor
could I blame him. It is easy to say
we might have taken warning, done
this or that, and come triumphant
through this attack. But only the fool
looks backward and says, &#8220;I would have
done better.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I tried</span> to summon my wits. The
ship was lost to us, unless Carter
and I could do something. Our futile
weapons! They were all here&ndash;&ndash;four or
five heat-ray hand projectors that could
send a pencil-ray a hundred feet or so.
I shot one diagonally up at the turret
where Johnson was leering down at our
rear window, but he saw my gesture
and dropped back out of sight. The
heat-beam flashed harmlessly up and
struck the turret roof. Then across the
turret window came a sheen of radiance&ndash;&ndash;an
electro-barrage. And behind it,
Hahn&#8217;s suave, evil face appeared. He
shouted down:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have orders to spare you, Gregg
Haljan&ndash;&ndash;or you would have been killed
long ago!&#8221;</p>
<p>My answering shot hit his barrage
with a shower of sparks, behind which
he stood unmoved.</p>
<p>Carter handed me another weapon.
&#8220;Gregg, try this.&#8221;</p>
<p>I levelled the old explosive bullet
projector; Carter crouched beside me.
But before I could press the trigger,
from somewhere down the starlit deck
an electro-beam hit me. The little rifle
exploded, burst its breech. I sank back
to the floor, tingling from the shock of
the hostile current. My hands were
blackened from the exploding powder.</p>
<p>Carter seized me. &#8220;No use! Hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> stars through the dome-windows
were swinging. A long swing&ndash;&ndash;the
shadows and starlit patches on
the deck were all shifting. The Planetara
was turning. The heavens revolved
in a great round sweep of movement,
then settled as we took our new
course. Hahn at the turret controls
had swung us. The earth and the sun
showed over our bow quarter. The
sunlight mingled red-yellow with the
brilliant starlight. Hahn&#8217;s signals were
sounding; I heard them answered from
the mechanism rooms down below.
Brigands there&ndash;&ndash;in full control. The
gravity plates were being set to the
new positions; we were on our new
course. Headed a point or two off the
Earth-line. Not headed for the moon?
I wondered.</p>
<p>Carter and I were planning nothing.
What was there to plan? We were under
observation. A Martian paralyzing
ray&ndash;&ndash;or electronic beam, far more
deadly than our own puny police weapons&ndash;&ndash;would
have struck us the instant
we tried to leave the chart-room.</p>
<p>My swift-running thoughts were interrupted
by a shout from down the
deck. At a corner of the cabin superstructure
some fifty feet from our windows
the figure of Miko appeared. A
barrage-radiance hung around him like
a shimmering mantle. His voice
sounded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg Haljan, do you yield?&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter leaped up from where he and
I were crouching. Against all reason
of safety he leaned from the low window,
waving his hamlike fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yield? No! I am in command here,
you pirate! Brigand&ndash;&ndash;murderer!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I pushed</span> him back. &#8220;Careful!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was spluttering, and over it
Miko&#8217;s sardonic laugh sounded. &#8220;Very
well&ndash;&ndash;but you will talk? Shall we argue
about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>I stood up. &#8220;What do you want to
say, Miko?&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind him the tall, thin figure of
his sister showed. She was plucking at
him. He turned violently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t hurt him! Gregg Haljan&ndash;&ndash;is
this a truce? You will not shoot?&#8221;
He was shielding Moa.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I called. &#8220;For a moment, no.
A truce. What is it you want to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could hear the babble of passengers
who were herded in the cabin with
brigands guarding them. George
Prince, bareheaded, but shrouded in his
cloak, showed in a patch of light behind
Moa. He looked my way and then
retreated into the lounge archway.</p>
<p>Miko called, &#8220;You must yield. We
want you, Haljan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; I jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alive. It is easy to kill you.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I could</span> not doubt that. Carter and
I were little more than rats in a
trap, here in the chart-room. But Miko
wanted to take me alive: that was not
so simple. He added persuasively:</p>
<p>&#8220;We want you to help us navigate.
Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you help us, Captain Carter?
Tell your cub, this Haljan, to yield.
You are fools. We understand that
Haljan has been handling the ship&#8217;s
mathematics. Him we need most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter roared: &#8220;Get back from there!
This is no truce!&#8221;</p>
<p>I shoved aside his levelled bullet-projector.
&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; I called to
<a name='TC_16'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Mika'">Miko</ins>. &#8220;Navigate&ndash;&ndash;where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;that is our business,
not yours. When you lay down
your weapons and come out of there, I
will give you the course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the earth?&#8221; I suggested.</p>
<p>I could fancy him grinning behind
the sheen of his barrage at my question.</p>
<p>&#8220;The earth? Yes&ndash;&ndash;shall we go there?
Give me your orders, Gregg Haljan. Of
course I will obey them.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sardonic words were interrupted.
And I realized that all this parley was
a ruse of Miko&#8217;s to take me alive. He
had made a gesture. Hahn, watching
from the turret window, doubtless
flashed a signal down to the hull-corridors.
The magnetizer control under
the chart-room was altered, our artificial
gravity cut off. I felt the sudden
lightness; I gripped the window casement
and clung. Carter was startled
into incautious movement. It flung
him out into the center of the chart-room,
his arms and legs grotesquely
flailing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">And</span> across the chart-room, in the
opposite window, I felt rather
than saw the shape of something. A
figure&ndash;&ndash;almost invisible, but not quite&ndash;&ndash;was
trying to climb in! I flung the
empty rifle I was holding. It hit something
solid in the window; in a flare of
sparks a black-hooded figure materialized.
A man climbing in! His weapon
spat. There was a tiny electronic flash,
deadly silent. The intruder had shot
at Carter; struck him. Carter gave one
queer scream. He had floated to the
floor; his convulsive movement when
he was hit hurled him to the ceiling.
His body struck, twitched; bounced
back and sank inert on the floor-grid almost
at my feet.</p>
<p>I clung to the casement. Across the
space of the weightless room the
hooded intruder was also clinging. His
hood fell back. It was Johnson. He
leered at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed him, the bully! Well, he deserved
it. Now for you, Mr. Third
Officer Haljan!&#8221;</p>
<p>But he did not dare fire at me&ndash;&ndash;Miko
had forbidden it. I saw him reach under
his robe, doubtless for a low-powered
paralyzing ray such as Miko
already had used on me. But he never
got it out. I had no weapon within
reach. I leaned into the room, still
holding the casement, and doubled my
legs under me. I kicked out from the
window.</p>
<p>The force <a name='TC_17'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'catapaulted'">catapulted</ins> me across the
space of the room like a volplane. I
struck the purser. We gripped. Our
locked, struggling bodies bounced out
into the room. We struck the floor,
surged up like balloons to the ceiling,
struck it with a flailing arm or a leg and
floated back.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Grotesque</span>, abnormal combat!
Like fighting in weightless water.
Johnson clutched his weapon, but
I twisted his wrist, held his arm outstretched
so that he could not aim it. I
was aware of Miko&#8217;s voice shouting on
the deck outside.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s left hand was gouging at
my face, his fingers plucking at my
eyes. We lunged down to the floor, then
up again, close to the ceiling.</p>
<p>I twisted his wrists. He dropped the
weapon and it sank away. I tried to
reach it, but could not. Then I had
him by the throat. I was stronger
than he, and more agile. I tried choking
him, his thick bull-neck within my
fingers. He kicked, scrambled, tore
and gouged at me. Tried to shout, but
it ended in a gurgle. And then, as he
felt his breath stopped, his hands came
up in an effort to tear mine loose.</p>
<p>We sank again to the floor. We
were momentarily upright. I felt my
feet touch. I bent my knees. We
sank further.</p>
<p>And then I kicked violently upward.
Our locked bodies shot to the ceiling.
Johnson&#8217;s head was above me. It struck
the steel roof of the chart-room. A
violent blow. I felt him go suddenly
limp. I cast him off, and, doubling
my body, I kicked at the ceiling. It
sent me diagonally downward to the
window, where I clung and regained
stability.</p>
<p>And I saw Miko standing on the
deck with a weapon levelled at me!</p>
<div class='chsp'>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<h4><i>The Torture</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">H</span><span class="dcap">aljan!</span> Yield or I&#8217;ll fire!
Moa, give me the smaller one.
This cursed&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had in his hand too large a projector.
Its ray would kill me. If he
wanted to take me alive, he would not
fire. I chanced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to draw myself beneath the
window. An automatic bullet projector
was on the floor where Carter had
dropped it. I pulled myself down.
Miko did not fire. I reached the revolver.
The dead bodies of the captain
and purser had drifted together on
the floor in the center of the room.</p>
<p>I hitched myself back to the window.
With upraised weapon I gazed cautiously
out. Miko had disappeared.
The deck within my line of vision was
empty.</p>
<p>But was it? Something told me to
beware. I clung to the casement, ready
upon the instant to shove myself down.
There was a movement in a shadow
along the deck. Then a figure rose up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fire, Haljan!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sharp command, half appeal,
stopped the pressure of my finger on
the trigger of the automatic. It was
the tall lanky Englishman, Sir Arthur
Coniston, as he called himself. So he
too was one of Miko&#8217;s band! The
light through a dome-window fell full
on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you fire, <a name='TC_18'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Halian'">Haljan</ins>, and kill me&ndash;&ndash;Miko
will kill you then, surely.&#8221;</p>
<p>From where he had been crouching
he could not command my window.
But now, upon the heels of his placating
words, he abruptly shot. The low-powered
ray, had it struck, would have
felled me without killing. But it went
over my head as I dropped. Its aura
made my senses reel.</p>
<p>Coniston shouted, &#8220;Haljan!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I did</span> not answer. I wondered if he
would dare approach to see if I had
been hit. A minute passed. Then another.
I thought I heard Miko&#8217;s voice
on the deck outside. But it was an
aerial, microscopic whisper close beside
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see you, Haljan! You must
yield!&#8221;</p>
<p>Their eavesdropping vibrations, with
audible projection, were upon me. I
retorted aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and get me! You cannot take
me alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do protest if this action of mine in
the chart-room may seem bravado. I
had no wish to die. There was within
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
me a very healthy desire for life. But
I felt, by holding out, that some chance
might come wherewith I might turn
events against these brigands. Yet
reason told me it was hopeless. Our
loyal members of the crew were killed,
no doubt. Captain Carter and Balch
were killed. The lookouts and Course-masters
also. And Blackstone.</p>
<p>There remained only Dr. Frank and
Snap. Their fate I did not yet know.
And there was George Prince. He,
perhaps, would help me if he could.
But, at best, he was a dubious ally.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very foolish, Haljan,&#8221; murmured
the projection of Miko&#8217;s voice.
And then I heard Coniston:</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, why would not a hundred
pounds of gold-leaf tempt you? The
code-words which were taken from
Johnson&ndash;&ndash;I mean to say, why not tell
us where they are?&#8221;</p>
<p>So that was one of the brigands new
difficulties! Snap had taken the code-word
sheet, that time we sealed the
purser in the cage.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll never find them. And
when a police ship sights us, what will
you do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>The chances of a police ship were
slim indeed, but the brigands evidently
did not know that. I wondered again
what had become of Snap. Was he captured&ndash;&ndash;or
still holding them off?</p>
<p>I was watching my windows; for at
any moment, under cover of this talk,
I might be assailed.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Gravity</span> came suddenly to the
room. Miko&#8217;s voice said.
&#8220;We mean well by you, Haljan. There
is your normality. Join us. We need
you to chart our course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a hundred pounds of gold-leaf,&#8221;
urged Coniston. &#8220;Or more. Why,
this treasure&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I could hear an oath from Miko. And
then his ironic voice: &#8220;We will not
bother you, Haljan. There is no hurry.
You will be hungry in good time. And
sleepy. Then we will come and get
you. And a little acid will make you
think differently about helping us....&#8221;</p>
<p>His vibrations died away. The pull
of gravity in the room was normal. I
was alone in the dim silence, with the
bodies of Carter and Johnson lying
huddled on the grid. I bent to examine
them. Both were dead.</p>
<p>My isolation was no ruse this time.
The outlaws made no further attack.
Half an hour passed. The deck outside,
what I could see of it, was vacant.
Balch lay dead close outside the chart-room
door. The bodies of Blackstone
and the Course-master had been removed
from the turret window. A forward
lookout&ndash;&ndash;one of Miko&#8217;s men&ndash;&ndash;was
on duty in the nearby tower. Hahn
was at the turret controls. The ship
was under orderly handling, heading
back upon a new course. For the
Earth? Or the Moon? It did not seem
so.</p>
<p>I found, in the chart-room, a Benson
curve-light projector which poor Captain
Carter had very nearly assembled.
I worked on it, trained it through my
rear window, along the empty deck;
bent it into the lounge archway. Upon
my grid the image of the lounge interior
presently <a name='TC_3'></a><ins title="Was 'focussed'">focused</ins>. The passengers
in the lounge were huddled in a
group. Disheveled, frightened, with
Moa standing watching them. Stewards
were serving them with a meal.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Upon</span> a bench, bodies were lying.
Some were dead. I saw Rance
Rankin. Others were evidently only
injured. Dr. Frank was moving among
them, attending them. Venza was
there, unharmed. And I saw the
gamblers, Shac and Dud, sitting
white-faced, whispering together. And
Glutz&#8217;s little be-ribboned, be-curled
figure on a stool.</p>
<p>George Prince was there, standing
against the walls shrouded in his
mourning cloak, watching the scene
with alert, roving eyes. And by the
opposite doorway, the huge towering
figure of Miko stood on guard. But
Snap was missing.</p>
<p>A brief glimpse. Miko saw my
Benson-light. I could have equipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
a heat-ray, and fired along the curved
Benson-light into that lounge. But
Miko gave me no time.</p>
<p>He slid the lounge door closed, and
Moa leaped to close the one on my side.
My light was cut off; my grid showed
only the blank deck and door.</p>
<p>Another interval. I had made plans.
Futile plans! I could get into the turret
perhaps, and kill Hahn. I had the
invisible cloak which Johnson was
wearing. I took it from his body. Its
mechanism could be repaired. Why,
with it I could creep about the ship,
kill these brigands one by one perhaps.
George Prince would be with me. The
brigands who had been posing as the
stewards and crew-members were unable
to navigate; they would obey my
orders. There were only Miko, Coniston
and Hahn to kill.</p>
<p>Futile plans! From my window I
could gaze up to the helio-room. And
now abruptly I heard Snap&#8217;s voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I tell you&ndash;&ndash;no!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Miko: &#8220;Very well. We will try
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Snap was captured, but not killed.
Relief swept me. He was in the helio-room,
and Miko was with him. But my
relief was short-lived.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">After</span> a brief interval there came
a moan from Snap. It floated
down from the silence overhead. It
made me shudder.</p>
<p>My Benson-beam shot into the helio
window. It showed me Snap lying
there on the floor. He was bound with
wire. His torso had been stripped. His
livid face was ghastly plain in my light.</p>
<p>Miko was bending over him. Miko
with a heat-cylinder no longer than a
finger. Its needle-beam played upon
Snap&#8217;s naked chest. I could see the
gruesome little trail of smoke rising;
and as Snap twisted and jerked, there
on his flesh was the red and blistered
trail of the violet-hot ray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now will you tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miko laughed. &#8220;No? Then I shall
write my name a little deeper....&#8221;</p>
<p>A black scar now&ndash;&ndash;a trail etched in
the quivering flesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Snap&#8217;s face went white as
chalk as he pressed his lips together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or a little acid? This fire-writing
does not really hurt? Tell me what
you did with those code-words!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>In his absorption Miko did not notice
my light. Nor did I have the wit
to try and fire along it. I was trembling.
Snap under torture!</p>
<p>As the beam went deeper, Snap
suddenly screamed. But he ended,
&#8220;No! I will send&ndash;&ndash;no message for
you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It had been only a moment. In the
chart-room window beside me again a
figure appeared! No image. A solid,
living person, undisguised by any cloak
of invisibility. George Prince had
chanced my fire and had crept up upon
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haljan! Don&#8217;t attack me.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I dropped</span> my light connections.
As impulsively I stood up, I saw
through the window the figure of Coniston
on the deck watching the result
of Prince&#8217;s venture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haljan&ndash;&ndash;yield.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prince no more than whispered it.
He stood outside on the deck; the low
window casement touched his waist.
He leaned over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s torturing Snap! Call out that
you will yield.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought had already been in my
mind. Another scream from Snap
chilled me with horror. I shouted,</p>
<p>&#8220;Miko! Stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>I rushed to the window and Prince
gripped me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Louder!&#8221;</p>
<p>I called louder. &#8220;<i>Miko!</i> Stop!&#8221;
My upflung voice mingled with Snap&#8217;s
agony of protest. Then Miko heard
me. His head and shoulders showed
up there at the helio-room oval.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Haljan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prince shouted, &#8220;I have made him
yield. He will obey you if you stop
that torture.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span></div>
<p>I think that poor Snap must have
fainted. He was silent. I called,
&#8220;Stop! I will do what you command.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miko jeered, &#8220;That is good. A bargain,
if you and Dean obey me. Disarm
him, Prince, and bring him out.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Miko</span> moved back into the helio-room.
On the deck Coniston
was advancing, but cautiously, mistrustful
of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>George Prince flung a leg over the
casement and leaped lightly into the
dim chart-room. His small slender
figure stood beside me, clung to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment, while we stood there together.
No ray was upon us. Coniston
could not see us, nor could he
hear our whispers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>A different voice; its throaty, husky
quality gone. A soft pleading.
&#8220;Gregg&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg, don&#8217;t you know me? Gregg,
dear....&#8221;</p>
<p>Why, what was this? Not George
Prince? A masquerader, yet so like
George Prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg, don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clinging to me. A soft touch upon
my arm. Fingers, clinging. A surge
of warm, tingling current was flowing
between us.</p>
<p>My sweep of instant thoughts. A
speck of human Earth-dust, falling free.
That was George Prince, who had been
killed. George Prince&#8217;s body, disguised
by the scheming Carter and Dr.
Frank, buried in the guise of his sister.
And this black-robed figure who was
trying to help us&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anita! Dear God! Anita, darling!
Anita!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg, dear one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anita! Dear God!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">My</span> arms went around her, my lips
pressed hers, and felt her tremulous,
eager answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregg, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anita, you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The form of Coniston showed at our
window. She cast me off. She said,
with her throaty swagger of assumed
masculinity:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have him, Sir Arthur. He will
obey us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sensed her warning glance. She
shoved me toward the window. She
said ironically, &#8220;Have no fear, Haljan.
You will not be tortured, you and
Dean, if you obey our commands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coniston gripped me. &#8220;You fool!
You caused us a lot of trouble, didn&#8217;t
you? Move along there!&#8221;</p>
<p>He jerked me roughly through the
window. Marched me the length of
the deck. Out to the stern-space;
opened the door of my cubby; flung me
in and sealed the door upon me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miko will come presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stood in the darkness of my tiny
room, listening to his retreating footsteps.
But my mind was not on
him....</p>
<p>All the Universe in that instant had
changed for me. Anita was alive!</p>

</p>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> train was slowing down
for Keegan. A whistle from
the locomotive ahead had
warned the two alert young
men in the smoker to that effect, and
they arose to
leave the train.
Both were neatly
and quietly dressed.
One carried
a medium-sized
camera with the
necessary tripod and accessory satchel.
The other carried no impediments of
any sort. Both were smoking cigars,
evidently not of expensive variety,
judging by the unaromatic atmosphere
thereabouts.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>Desperately O&#8217;Hara plunged into Prof.
Kell&#8217;s mysterious mansion. For his friend
Skip was the victim of the eccentric scientist&#8217;s
de-astralizing experiment, and faced
a fate more hideous than death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t see what
Bland shipped us
up to this one-horse
dump for,&#8221;
grumbled Skip
Handlon, the one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
who carried the camera. He was the
slighter of the two and perhaps half a
head shorter than the other. &#8220;Do you
know anything about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; confessed the other as
they alighted from the smoker. &#8220;All
I can tell you is that Bland sent for
me early this morning, told me to get
a story out of this Professor Kell and
to drag you along. After we get there
you are to do as judgment dictates.
But I remember that the Chief was
specific as regards one thing. You are
to get the proff&#8217;s mug. Don&#8217;t forget.
The old fellow may growl and show
fight, but it&#8217;s up to you to deliver the
goods&ndash;&ndash;or, in this case, get them.
Don&#8217;t depend on me for help. I expect
to have troubles of my own.&#8221;
Thus gloomed Horace Perry, star reporter
for the Journal.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Keegan place&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Handlon was
using his eyes swiftly and comprehensively&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;isn&#8217;t
worth much. Can&#8217;t see
how it manages to even rate a name.
Some dump, all right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said a couple mouthfuls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the train service, if any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rotten. Two trains a day.&#8221; The
other was anything but enthusiastic.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve a nice long wait for the next
one, you can bet. Now, just add to
that a rough reception after we reach
the old lion&#8217;s lair and you get a nice
idea of what Bland expects from his
men.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Handlon</span> made a wry face at
this. &#8220;The bird who first applied
the words &#8216;Hard Boiled&#8217; to the
Chief&#8217;s monniker knew something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know the half of it,&#8221; retorted
Perry encouragingly. &#8220;Just
wait and see what a beaut of a fit he
can throw for <i>your</i> benefit if you fail
to do your stuff&ndash;&ndash;and I don&#8217;t mean
maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Man Bland owned the Journal,
hired and fired his crew and did his
own editing, with the help of as capable
an office gang as could be gotten
together. It is quite possible that
&#8220;Hard Boiled&#8221; Bland demanded more
from his men than any other editor
ever has before or since. Nevertheless
he got results, and none of his experienced
underlings ever kicked, for the
pay was right. If a hapless scribe had
the temerity to enter the editorial
sanctum with a negative report, the almost
invariable reply had been a glare
and a peremptory order, &#8220;Get the
copy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And get it they did. If a person refused
an interview these clever fellows
generally succeeded in getting their information
from the next most reliable
source, and it arrived in print just the
same.</p>
<p>Of such a breed was Perry. Handlon,
being a more recent acquisition to
the staff, was not yet especially aggressive
in his work. On this account the
former took keen zest in scaring him
into displaying a bit more sand.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> train had disappeared around
a bend and the two reporters felt
themselves marooned. Keegan, without
question, was a most forlorn looking
spot. A dismal shanty, much the
worse for weather, stood beside the
track. In front, a few rotting planks
proclaimed that once upon a time the
place had boasted a real freight platform.
Probably, back in some long-forgotten
age, a station agent had also
held forth in the rickety shanty. A
sign hung on each end of the crumbling
structure on which could still be
deciphered the legend &#8220;KEEGAN.&#8221;
On the opposite side of the track was
an old, disused siding. The only other
feature of interest thereabouts was a
well traveled country road which
crossed the tracks near the shanty,
wound sinuously over a rock-strewn
hill and became lost in the mazes of
an upland forest.</p>
<p>There being no signboard of any
kind to indicate their destination, the
two, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation,
started off briskly in a chance direction.
The air was hot and sultry, and
in the open spaces the sun beat down
mercilessly upon the two hapless ones.
As they proceeded into the depths of
the forest they were shielded somewhat
from the worst of the heat.
Gradually upon their city-bred nostrils
there stole the odor of conifers,
accompanied by a myriad of other forest
odors. Both sniffed the air appreciatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is sure the life,&#8221; remarked
Perry. &#8220;If I weren&#8217;t so darn thirsty
now....&#8221; He became lost in mournful
thought.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A considerable</span> time passed.
The newspaper men trudged
wearily along until finally another
bend brought them to the beginning of
a steep descent. The forest had thinned
out to nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me I smell smoke,&#8221;
blurted out Handlon suddenly. &#8220;Must
be that we are approaching the old
party&#8217;s lair. Remember? Bland said
that he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh!&#8221; the other grunted, almost
inaudibly. Now that they seemed to
be arriving at their destination something
had occurred to him. He had
fished from his pocket a sheaf of clippings
and was perusing them intently.
&#8220;Bland said, &#8216;Get the copy&#8217;,&#8221; he muttered
irrelevantly and half to himself.</p>
<p>The clippings all related directly to
Professor Kell or to happenings local
to Keegan. Some were of peculiar interest.
The first one was headlined
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span></div>
<p class='center'>MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE
OF ROBERT MANION
AND DAUGHTER STILL
UNSOLVED</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece contained a description of
the missing man, a fairly prosperous
banker who had been seen four days
previously driving through Keegan in
a small roadster, and one of the girl,
who was in the car with him. It told
that the banker and his daughter were
last seen by a farmer named Willetts
who lived in a shack on the East Keegan
road, fleeing before a bad thunder
storm. He believed the pair were trying
to make the Kell mansion ahead
of the rain. Nothing more of the
Manions or their car had been seen,
and their personal effects remained at
their hotel in a nearby village unclaimed.
The heavy rain had of course
effectually obliterated all wheel tracks.</p>
<p>Another clipping was fairly lengthy,
but Perry glanced only at the headlines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='center'>KELL STILL CARRYING ON
HIS STRANGE EXPERIMENTS</p>
<p class='center'>Has Long Been Known to Have
Fantastic Theories. Refuses to
Divulge Exact Methods Employed,
or Nature of Results</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still another appeared to be an excerpt
from an article in an agricultural
paper. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A prize bull belonging to Alton
Shepard, a Keegan cattle breeder,
has created considerable sensation
by running amuck in a most peculiar
manner. While seemingly
more intelligent than heretofore,
it has developed characteristics
known to be utterly alien to this
type of animal.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy
feature of the case is the refusal
of the animal to eat its accustomed
food. Instead it now consumes
enormous quantities of meat. The
terrific bellow of the animal&#8217;s voice
has also undergone a marked
change, now resembling nothing
earthly, although some have remarked
that it could be likened to
the bay of an enormous hound.
Some of its later actions have
seemingly added further canine
attributes, which make the matter
all the more mystifying. Veterinaries
are asking why this animal
should chase automobiles, and why
it should carry bones in its mouth
and try to bury them!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last one read in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Kell has been questioned
by authorities at Keegan
relative to the disappearance there
last Tuesday of Robert Manion and
his daughter. Kell seemed unable
to furnish clues of any value, but
officials are not entirely satisfied
with the man&#8217;s attitude toward the
questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat bewildered by these apparently
unrelated items, the reporter
remained lost in thought for quite a
space, the while he endeavored to map
out his course of action when he should
meet the redoubtable Professor. That
many of the weird occurrences could be
traced in some way to the latter&#8217;s door
had evidently occurred to Bland. Furthermore,
the Old Man relied implicitly
upon Perry to get results.</p>
<p>It must be said that for once the star
reporter was not overly enthusiastic
with the assignment. Certain rumors
aside from the clippings in his hand
had produced in his mind a feeling of
uneasiness. So far as his personal
preference was concerned he would
have been well satisfied if some cub reporter
had been given the job. Try as
he would, however, he could offer no
tangible reason for the sudden wariness.</p>
<p>He was aroused from his absorption
by his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I smelled smoke a while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
back, and I was right. That&#8217;s the
house up in the edge of the pines.
Deep grounds in front and all gone to
seed; fits the description exactly.
Thank Heaven we struck off from the
station in the right direction. This
stroll has been long enough. Come out
of it and let&#8217;s get this job finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the words
Handlon started off at a brisk pace
down the hill, followed at a more moderate
rate by Perry. At length they
came within full sight of the grounds.
Extending for a considerable distance
before them and enclosing a large tract
of land now well covered with lush
grass, was a formidable looking wall.
In former days a glorious mantle of
ivy had covered the rough stones; but
now there was little left, and what
there was looked pitifully decrepit.
They continued their progress along
this barrier, finally coming upon a huge
iron gate now much the worse for rust.
It stood wide open.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> road up to the house had long
since become overgrown with
rank grass and weeds. Faintly traceable
through the mass of green could
be seen a rough footpath which the
two followed carefully. They met no
one. As they approached the night of
black pines the mass of the old mansion
began to loom up before them,
grim and forbidding.</p>
<p>Instinctively both shivered. The silence
of the place was complete and of
an uncannily tangible quality. Nervously
they looked about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like it, Skip?&#8221; The
words from Perry&#8217;s previously silent
lips broke upon the stillness like a
thunderclap. The other started.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hate to die in it,&#8221; Handlon
answered solemnly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet the old
joint is haunted. Nobody but a lunatic
would ever live in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get a good deal the same impression
myself,&#8221; said Perry. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder
that Bland sent two of us to cover
the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke he mounted a flight of
steps to a tumbledown veranda. There
was no sign of a door bell on the
weather-beaten portal, but an ancient
knocker of bronze hanging forlornly
before him seemed to suggest a means
of attracting attention. He raised it
and rapped smartly.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">No</span> answer.</p>
<p>Possessing all the attributes of
the conventional reporter and a few
additional ones, Perry did not allow
himself to become disheartened, but
merely repeated his summons, this
time with more vim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Horace,&#8221; grinned Handlon,
&#8220;it does look as if we were not so very
welcome here. However, seems to me
if you were to pick up that piece of
dead limb and do some real knocking
with it.... The dear Professor may
be deaf, you know, or maybe he&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skip, my boy, I don&#8217;t know as we
ought to go in right now after all. Do
you realize it will soon be dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth, Horace, I&#8217;m
not stuck on this assignment either.
And I feel that after dark I should
like it even less, somehow. But, gee,
the Old Man....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not thinking of quitting on
the job. We don&#8217;t do that on the Journal.&#8221;
Perry smiled paternally at the
photographer. Could it be he had purposely
raised the other&#8217;s hopes in order
to chaff him some more? &#8220;But I
was thinking that it might be a good
idea to look about the outbuildings a
bit while we have a little daylight.
Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Handlon looked disappointed, but
nodded gamely. He delayed only long
enough to deposit his camera and traps
behind a grossly overgrown hydrangea
by the steps, then, with a resigned air,
declared himself ready to follow wherever
the other might lead.</p>
<p>Perry elected to explore the barn
first. This was a depressing old pile,
unpainted in years, with what had once
been stout doors now swinging and
bumping in the light breeze. As the
two men drew nearer, this breeze&ndash;&ndash;which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
seemed to sigh through the
place at will&ndash;&ndash;brought foul odors that
told them the place was at least not
tenantless. In some trepidation they
stepped inside and stood blinking in
the half darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty Polly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God! What was that?&#8221; Handlon
whispered. He knew it was no
parrot&#8217;s voice. This was a far deeper
sound than that, a sound louder than
anything a parrot&#8217;s throat could produce.
It came from the direction of a
ruinous stall over near a cobwebbed
window. As Perry started fearfully
toward this, there issued from it a curious
scraping sound, followed by a fall
that shook the floor, and a threshing as
of hoofs. Now the great voice could
be heard again, this time uttering what
sounded strangely like oaths roared
out in a foreign tongue. Yet when
the newspaper men reached the stall
they found it occupied only by a large
mule.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> animal was lying on its side,
its feet scraping feebly against
the side of the stall. The heaving,
foam-flecked body was a mass of hideous
bruises, some of which were bleeding
profusely. The creature seemed
to be in the last stage of exhaustion,
lying with lips drawn back and eyes
closed. Beneath it and scattered all
over the stall floor was a thick layer
of some whitish seeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;why that&#8217;s sunflower seed,
Horace!&#8221; Handlon almost whimpered.
&#8220;And look! Look in that crib! It&#8217;s
full of the same stuff! Where&#8217;s the
hay, Horace? Does this thing&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a mighty
movement of the beast&ndash;&ndash;a threshing
that nearly blinded the men in the
cloud of bloodstained seeds it raised.
With something between a curse and a
sob, the mule lunged at its crib as if
attempting to get bodily into it. But
no: it was only trying to perch on its
edge! Now it had succeeded. The
ungainly beast hung there a second,
two, three. From its uplifted throat
issued that usually innocuous phrase,
a phrase now a thing of delirious horror:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty Polly!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a crash the tortured creature
fell to the floor, to lie there gasping
and moaning.</p>
<p>Skip Handlon left that barn. Perry
retained just enough wit to do what he
should have done the instant he first
saw the animal. He whipped out his
automatic and fired one merciful shot.
Then he too started for the outside.
He arrived in the yard perhaps ten
seconds behind Handlon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, Perry,&#8221; gibbered
Handlon. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to stay
around this place another minute. Just
let me find where I left that suffering
camera, that&#8217;s all I ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy now.&#8221; Perry laid a hand on
his companion&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;I guess
we&#8217;re up against something pretty
fierce here, but we&#8217;re going to see it
through, and you know it. So let&#8217;s cut
out the flight talk and go raise the
Professor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Handlon tried earnestly to don a
look of determination. If Perry was
set on staying here the least he could
do was stay with him. However, could
Perry have foreseen the events which
were to entangle them, he probably
would have led the race to the gate.
As it was, he grasped a stick and
marched bravely up toward the front
door.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A sudden</span> commotion behind him
caused him to wheel sharply
around. Simultaneously a yell burst
from Handlon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out, Horace!&#8221;</p>
<p>What he saw almost froze the blood
in his veins. From a tumbledown
coach house had issued an enormous
wolf-hound which was now almost
upon then, eyes flaming, fangs gleaming
horribly.</p>
<p>So unexpected was the attack that
both men stood rooted in their tracks.
The next moment the charging brute
was upon them, and had bowled Handlon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
off his equilibrium as if he were a
child. The unfortunate photographer
made a desperate attempt to prevent
injury to his precious camera, which
he had but a moment earlier succeeded
in retrieving, and in doing so fell
rather violently to the ground. Every
moment he expected to feel the powerful
jaws crunch his throat, and he
made no effort to rise. For several
seconds he remained thus, until he
could endure the suspense no longer.
He glanced around only to see Perry,
staring open-mouthed at the animal
which had so frightened them. Apparently
it had forgotten the presence
of the two men.</p>
<p>Handlon regained his feet rather
awkwardly, the while keeping a watchful
eye on the beast, of whose uncertain
temper he was by now fully aware.
In an undertone he addressed his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221; he
wanted to know. &#8220;Did the critter bite
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. That&#8217;s the queer part of it.
Neither did he bite you, if you were
to think it over a minute. Just put his
nose down and <i>rammed</i> you, head on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The photographer was flabbergasted.
Involuntarily his gaze stole again in
the direction of the offending brute.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began. &#8220;Is he
sharpening his teeth on a rock preparatory
to another attack upon us? Or&ndash;&ndash;What
the deuce <i>is</i> he doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ask me,&#8221; came astonishingly
from the watchful Perry, &#8220;he&#8217;s eating
grass, which is my idea of something
damn foolish for a perfectly normal
hound, genus lupo, to be&ndash;&ndash;Look out!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> animal, as if suddenly remembering
the presence of the men,
suddenly charged at them again, head
down, eyes blazing. As before, it made
no effort to bite. Though both men
were somewhat disconcerted by the
great brute they held their ground, and
when it presented the opportunity the
older reporter planted a terrific kick
to the flank which sent the animal
whimpering back to its shed behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Score one,&#8221; breathed Handlon. &#8220;If
we&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; At a sudden grating sound overhead,
he stopped.</p>
<p>Both turned to face the threatening
muzzle of an ancient blunderbuss. Behind
it was an irate countenance, nearly
covered by an unclipped beard of a
dirty gray color. In the eyes now
glaring at them malevolently through
heavily concaved spectacles they read
hate unutterable. The barrel of the
blunderbuss swung slightly as it covered
alternately one and the other.
Both sensed that the finger even now
tightening on the trigger would not
hesitate unduly. Being more or less
hardened to rebuffs of all kinds in the
pursuance of their calling, the reporters
did not hesitate in stating
their purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; yelled the old man. &#8220;You
dare to invade my grounds and disturb
me at my labors for such a reason?
Reporters! My scientific research work
is not for publicity, sirs; and futhermore
I want it understood that I am
not to be dragged from my laboratory
again for the purpose of entertaining
you or any others of your ilk. Get
away!&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further ado the window
was slammed down, a shutter closed
on the inside, and once more the silence
of the dead descended upon the
spot. The two men grinned ruefully
at each other, Handlon finally breaking
the stillness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My idea of the world&#8217;s original one-sided
conversation. We simply didn&#8217;t
talk&ndash;&ndash;and yet we&#8217;re supposed to be reporters.
You&#8217;ve got to hand it to the
Proff, Horace, for the beautiful rock-crusher
he just handed us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t think we had anything
easy, did you?&#8221; said Perry irritably.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll change his tune presently,
when&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Handlon</span>&#8217;s jaw dropped. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to take
any more chances! Would you rouse
him again after the way he treated us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
with that gun? Besides, the train....&#8221;</p>
<p>Perry bent a scathing glance at his
companion. &#8220;What on earth has the
train to do with our getting the Professor&#8217;s
confession of crime or whatever
he has to offer? You evidently
don&#8217;t know Bland&ndash;&ndash;much. I deduce
that a lot of my sweetness has been
wasted on the desert air. Once more,
let me assure you that if you propose
to go back without the Proff&#8217;s mug on
one of those plates you might as well
mail your resignation from <i>here</i>. Get
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other wilted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; Perry ruminated as he
stared in the direction of the shed
wherein the canine monstrosity had
disappeared. &#8220;Do you suppose that
you can get a snap of the old boy&#8217;s
mug if I can get him to the window
again? If you can do that, just leave
the rest to me. I&#8217;ve handled these
crusty birds before. What say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go as far as you like.&#8221; The photographer
was once more grinning as he
unslung his camera and carefully adjusted
a plate in place. Everything
at last to his satisfaction he gripped
flash pan and bulb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make some racket
now,&#8221; announced Perry grimly. &#8220;If
Kell shows up, work fast. He may
shoot at you, but don&#8217;t get excited.
It&#8217;s almost dark, so his aim <i>might</i> be
poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this suggestion his companion
showed signs of panic, but the other
affected not to notice this. There came
a deafening hullaballoo as Perry beat
a <a name='TC_45'></a><ins class='trchange' title="was 'terriffic'">terrific</ins> tattoo on the ancient door.
Followed a deep silence, while Perry
leaped back to stand in front of Skip
and his camera. After perhaps a full
minute&#8217;s wait he once more opened up
his bombardment, to jump quickly
back to the camera as before. This
time he had better success. The window
was again opened and the muzzle
of the blunderbuss put in its appearance.
Handlon stood close behind
Perry as he silently swung the camera
into a more favorable position for action.
The face at the window was purple
with wrath.</p>
<p>&#8220;You damned pests! Leave my
grounds at once or I shall call my
hound and set him upon you. And
when&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Crack!</span> Flash! Click! Perry
had made a sudden sidewise
movement as Handlon went into action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged, Professor,&#8221; said
Perry politely. &#8220;Your pose with that
old cannon is going to be very effective
from the front page. The write-up
will doubtless be interesting too.
Probably the story won&#8217;t be quite so
accurate as it would be had you told
it to us yourself; but we shall get as
many of the details from the natives
hereabouts as we can. Good-day to you,
sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>Motioning to the other he turned on
his heel and started down the driveway.
It was an old trick, and for a
long moment of suspense he almost
feared that it would fail. Another
moment&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; The quavering voice of the
irascible old villain had lost some of
its malice. &#8220;Come back here a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>With simulated reluctance the two
slowly retraced their steps. &#8220;Is there
something else, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps....&#8221; The old man hesitated,
as if pondering upon his words.
&#8220;Perhaps if you care to step in I can
be of assistance to you after all. It
occurs to me that possibly I have been
too abrupt with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad that you have decided
to cooperate with us, Professor
Kell,&#8221; answered the reporter heartily,
as they ascended the steps. The old
man&#8217;s head disappeared from the window
and shortly the sound of footsteps
inside told of his approach. Finally
the oaken door swung open, and they
were silently ushered into the musty
smelling hallway. Though outwardly
accepting the Professor&#8217;s suddenly
pacific attitude, Perry made up his
mind to be on his guard.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">As</span> they entered what had evidently
been the parlor in bygone days,
an oppressive, heavy odor smote
their nostrils, telling of age-old carpets
and of draperies allowed to decay
unnoticed. On the walls hung
several antique prints, a poorly executed
crayon portrait of a person
doubtless an ancestor of the present
Kell, and one or two paintings done
in oil, now badly cracked and stained.
Everything gave the impression of an
era long since departed, and the two
men felt vaguely out of place. Their
host led them to a pair of dilapidated
chairs, which they accepted gratefully.
The ride to Keegan after a hard day&#8217;s
work had not tended to improve their
spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now to business.&#8221; Perry went
straight to the point, desiring to get
the interview over as soon as possible.
&#8220;We have heard indirectly of various
happenings in this vicinity which
many think have some connection with
your scientific experiments. Any
statement you may care to make to us
in regard to these happenings will be
greatly appreciated by my paper. Inasmuch
as what little has already been
printed is probably of an erroneous
nature, we believe it will be in your
own best interest to give us as complete
data as possible.&#8221; Here he became
slightly histrionic. &#8220;Of course
we do not allow ourselves to take the
stories told by the local inhabitants too
literally, as such persons are too liable
to exaggerate, but we must assume that
some of these stories have partial
basis in fact. Any information relative
to your scientific work, incidentally,
will make good copy for us also.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perry gazed steadily at the patriarch
as he spoke. For a moment, a crafty
expression passed over the old man&#8217;s
face, but as suddenly it disappeared.
Evidently he had arrived at a decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he wheezed.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> two newspaper men exchanged
swift glances, the same
thought in the mind of each. Were they
about to be led into a trap? If the old
man&#8217;s shady reputation was at all deserved
they would do well to be wary.
Perry thought swiftly of the clippings
he had read and of what gossip he had
heard, then glanced once more in the
direction of Handlon. That worthy
was smiling meaningly and had already
arisen to follow the Professor.
Reluctantly Perry got to his feet and
the three proceeded to climb a rickety
stairway to the third floor. The guide
turned at the head of the stairs and entered
a long dark corridor. Here the
floor was covered with a thick carpet
which, as they trod upon it, gave forth
not the slightest sound.</p>
<p>The hall gave upon several rooms,
all dark and gloomy and giving the
same dismal impression of long disuse.
How could the savant endure
such a depressing abode! The accumulation
of dust and cobwebs in these
long forgotten chambers, the general
evidence of decay&ndash;&ndash;all told of possible
horrors ahead. They became wary.</p>
<p>But they were not wary enough!</p>
<p>The uncouth figure ahead of them
had stopped and was fumbling with
the lock of an ancient door. Instinctively
Perry noted that it was of great
thickness and of heavy oak. Now the
Professor had it open and was motioning
for them to enter. Handlon started
forward eagerly, but hurriedly drew
back as he felt the grip of the other
reporter&#8217;s hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back, you fool!&#8221; The words
were hissed into the ear of the incautious
one. Then, to the Professor,
Perry observed: &#8220;If you have no objection
we would prefer that you precede
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A look of insane fury leaped to the
face of the old man, lingered but an
instant and was gone. Though the expression
was but momentary, both men
had seen, and seeing had realized their
danger.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">They</span> followed him into the chamber,
which was soon illumined fitfully
by a smoky kerosene lamp. Both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
took a rapid survey of the place. Conceivably
it might have been the scene
of scientific experiments, but its aspect
surely belied such a supposition.
The average imagination would instantly
pronounce it the abode of a
maniac, or the lair of an alchemist.
Again, that it might be the laboratory
of an extremely slovenly veterinary
was suggested by the several filthy
cages to be seen resting against the
wall. All of these were unoccupied
except one in a dark corner, from
which issued a sound of contented
purring, evidently telling of some well-satisfied
cat.</p>
<p>The air was close and foul, being
heavy with the odor of musty, decaying
drugs. In every possible niche and
cranny the omnipresent dust had settled
in a uniform sheen of gray which
showed but few signs of recent disturbance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, gentlemen,&#8221; their host was
saying, &#8220;is where I carry on my work.
It is rather gloomy here after dark, but
then I do not spend much time here
during the night. I have decided to
acquaint you with some of the details
of one or two of my experiments.
Doubtless you will find them interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>While speaking he had, mechanically
it seemed, reached for a glass humidor
in which were perhaps a dozen cigars.
Silently he selected one and extended
the rest to the two visitors.</p>
<p>After all three had puffed for a moment
at the weeds, the old man began
to talk, rapidly it seemed to them.
Perry from time to time took notes, as
the old man proceeded, an expression
of utter amazement gradually overspreading
his face. Handlon pulled
away contentedly at his cigar, and on
his features there grew an almost ludicrous
expression of well-being. Was
the simple photographer so completely
at ease that he had at length forsaken
all thought of possible danger?</p>
<p>As Professor Kell talked on he
seemed to warm to his subject. At the
end of five minutes he began uncovering
a peculiar apparatus which had
rested beneath the massive old table
before which they were sitting. The
two men caught the flash of light on
glass, and a jumble of coiled wires became
visible.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Was</span> the air in the laboratory
getting unbearably close? Or
was the queer leaden feeling that had
taken possession of Perry&#8217;s lungs but
an indication of his overpowering
weariness? He felt a steadily increasing
irritation, as if for some strange
reason he suddenly resented the words
of their host, which seemed to be pouring
out in an endless stream. The
cigar had, paradoxically, an oddly
soothing quality, and he puffed away
in silence.</p>
<p>Why had the room suddenly taken
on so hazy an aspect? Why did Handlon
grin in that idiotic manner? And
the Professor ... he was getting farther
and farther away ... that perfecto
... or was it an El Cabbajo?
What was the old archfiend doing to
him anyhow?... Why was he laughing
and leering at them so horribly?...
Confound it all ... that cigar
... where was it?... Just one more
puff....</p>
<p>Blindly he groped for the missing
weed, becoming aware of a cackle of
amusement nearby. Professor Kell was
standing near the spot where he had
fallen and now began prodding him
contemptuously with his toe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fools!&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;You
thought to interfere with my program.
But you are in my power and you have
no hope of escape. I am unexpectedly
provided with more subjects for my
experiments. You will....&#8221; His
words became hazy and unintelligible,
for the hapless reporter was drifting
off into a numb oblivion. He had long
since lost the power to move a muscle.
Out of the corner of an eye, just before
he lost consciousness altogether, he
perceived Handlon lying upon the
floor still puffing at the fateful drugged
cigar.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Eons</span> passed.</p>
<p>To the reporter came a vision
of a throbbing, glaring inferno, wherein
he was shaken and tossed by terrific
forces. His very vital essence seemed
to respond to a mighty vibration. Now
he was but a part of some terrific chaos.
Dimly he became aware of another being
with whom he must contend. Now
he was in a death struggle, and to his
horror he found himself being slowly
but surely overpowered. A demoniac
grin played upon the features of the
other as he forced the reporter to his
knees. It was Handlon.... Once
more he was sinking into soft oblivion,
the while a horrid miasma assailed his
nostrils. He was nothing....</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Slowly,</span> and with infinite effort,
Perry felt himself returning to
consciousness, though he had no clear
conception of his surroundings. His
brain was as yet but a whirling vortex
of confused sounds, colors and&ndash;&ndash;yes,
odors. A temporary rift came in the
mental cloud which fettered his faculties,
and things began to take definite
shape. He became aware that he was
lying upon his back at some elevation
from the floor. Again the cloudy incubus
closed in and he knew no more.</p>
<p>When he finally recovered the use of
his faculties it was to discover himself
the possessor of a violent headache.
The pain came in such fearsome throbs
that it was well nigh unendurable. The
lamp still sputtered dimly where the
professor had left it. At the moment
it was on the point of going out altogether.
The reporter noticed this, and
over him stole a sense of panic. What
if the light should fail altogether, leaving
him lying in the dark in this frightful
place! Still dizzy and sick, he managed
to rise upon his elbows enough to
complete a survey of the room. He
was still in the laboratory of Professor
Kell, but that worthy had disappeared.
Of Handlon there was no sign. The
mysterious apparatus, of which he now
had but a vague remembrance, also had
vanished.</p>
<p>His thoughts became confused again,
and wearily he passed a hand over his
brow in the effort to collect all of his
faculties. The lamp began to sputter,
arousing him to action. Desperately
he fought against the benumbing sensation
that was even again stealing over
him. Gradually he gained the ascendancy.
He struggled dizzily to his feet
and took a few tentative steps.</p>
<p>Where was Handlon? He decided
his friend had probably recovered from
the drug first and was gone, possibly
to get a doctor for him, Perry. However,
he must make some search to determine
if Skip had really left the
premises.</p>
<p>As he walked through the open door
the lamp in his hand gave a last despairing
flicker and went out. From
there he was forced to grope his way
down the dark hall to the stairs. Just
how he reached the lower floor he was
never able to remember, for as yet all
the effect of the powerful drug had
not worn off. He had a dim recollection
of being thankful to the ancestor
of Kell who had provided such thick
carpets in these halls. Thanks to them
his footsteps had been noiseless, at any
rate.</p>
<p>What was Kell&#8217;s real object in giving
them those drugged cigars? he
wondered. How long had they been
under the influence of the lethal stuff?
Surely several hours. Upon glancing
through a hall window he found that
outside was the blackness of midnight.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Cautiously</span> he explored the
desolate chambers on the ground
floor: the kitchen&ndash;&ndash;where it could be
plainly seen that cooking of a sort had
been done&ndash;&ndash;the barn, and woodshed.
Not a living thing could he find, not
even the huge wolf-hound which had
attacked them in so strange a manner
that afternoon.</p>
<p>By now he was quite frankly worried
on Handlon&#8217;s account. At that
moment, could he have known the actual
fate that had overtaken his companion,
it is quite probable he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
have gone mad. He stumbled back and
into the dark front hall, shouting his
friend&#8217;s name. The response was a
hollow echo, and once or twice he
thought he heard the ghost of a mocking
chuckle.</p>
<p>At length he gave up the search and
started for the door, intent now only
upon flight from the accursed place.
He would report the whole thing to the
office and let Bland do what he pleased
about it. Doubtless Handlon had already
left. Then he stumbled over
Handlon&#8217;s camera. Evidently the Professor
had neglected to take possession
of it. That must be rescued, at all
costs. He picked it up and felt the
exposed plate still inside. He started
again for the door.</p>
<p>What little light there was faded out
and he felt stealing over him a horrid
sensation of weakness. Again came a
period of agony during which he felt
the grip of unseen forces. Once more
it seemed that he was engaged in mortal
strife with Skip Handlon. Malevolently
Handlon glared at him as he endeavored
with all his strength to overcome
Perry. This time, however, the
latter seemed to have more strength
and resisted the attack for what must
have been hours. Finally the other
drew away baffled.</p>
<p>At this the mental incubus surrounding
Perry&#8217;s faculties broke. Dimly he
became aware of a grinding noise nearby
and a constant lurching of his body.
At length his vision cleared sufficiently
to enable him to discover the cause
of the peculiar sensations.</p>
<p>He was in a railroad coach!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> took a rapid glance around and
noted a drummer sitting in the
seat across the aisle, staring curiously
at him. With an effort Perry assumed
an inscrutable expression and determined
to stare the other out of countenance.
Reluctantly the man glanced
away, and after a moment, under Perry&#8217;s
stony gaze, he suddenly arose and
chose a new seat in front of the car.
Perry took to the solace of a cigarette
and stared out at the flying telegraph
poles. From time to time he noted
familiar landmarks. The train had evidently
left Keegan far behind and was
already nearly into the home town.</p>
<p>For the balance of the ride the reporter
experienced pure nightmare.
The peculiar sensations of dizziness,
accompanied by frightful periods of
insensibility, kept recurring, now,
however, not lasting more than ten or
fifteen minutes at a time. At such
times as he was conscious he found opportunity
to wonder in an abstracted
sort of way how he had ever managed
to get on the train and pay his fare,
which must have been a cash one, without
arousing the conductor&#8217;s suspicions.
Discovery of a rebate in his
pocket proved that he must have done
so, however. The business of leaving
the train and getting to the office has
always been an unknown chapter in
Perry&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>He came out of one of his mental
fogs to find himself seated in the private
editorial sanctum of the Journal.
Evidently he had just arrived. Bland,
a thick-set man with the jaw of a bulldog,
was eyeing him intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Any report to make?&#8221; The
question was crisp.</p>
<p>The reporter passed a hand across
his perspiring forehead. &#8220;Yes, I guess
so. I&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;you see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Handlon? What happened
to you? You act as if you were drunk.&#8221;
Bland was not in an amiable mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me,&#8221; Perry managed to respond.
&#8220;If Skip isn&#8217;t here old man
Kell must have done for him. I came
back alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wha-a-t?&#8221; the irate editor fairly
roared, half rising from his chair.
&#8220;Tell me exactly what happened and
get ready to go back there on the next
train. Or&ndash;&ndash;no, on second thoughts
you&#8217;d better go to bed. You look all
used up. Handlon may be dead or dying
at this minute. That Kell could
do anything.&#8221; He pressed the button
on his desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnny,&#8221; he said to the office boy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
&#8220;get O&#8217;Hara in here on the double
quick and tell him to bring along his
hat and coat.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> turned again to Perry, who
was gazing nervously at the
door. &#8220;Now tell me everything that
happened and make it fast,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>The reporter complied, omitting
nothing except the little matter of his
mental lapses at the house of Professor
Kell and later on the train. The incident
of the drugged cigars seemed to
interest the Old Man hugely, and Perry
did not forget to play up Handlon&#8217;s exploits
in getting the picture of the
Professor. All through the recital he
was in a sweat for fear that he might
have a recurrence of one of his brain
spells and that Bland would become
cognizant of it. When would the Chief
finish and let him escape from the office?
Desperately he fought to prevent
the numbing sensation from overcoming
him. All that kept him from
finally fleeing the place in panic was
the entrance of Jimmie O&#8217;Hara.</p>
<p>Slight, wiry and efficient looking,
this individual was a specimen of the
perfect Journal reporter. This is saying
a good deal, for the news crew and
editorial force of the <a name='TC_46'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Removed comma">paper</ins> were a
carefully selected body of men indeed.
Bland never hired a man unless experience
had endowed him with some
unusual qualification. Most of them
could write up a story with realistic
exactitude, being able in most cases
to supply details gleaned from actual
experience in one walk of life or another.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Of</span> this redoubtable crew probably
the queerest was Jimmie O&#8217;Hara.
Jimmie had just finished a sentence in
the &#8220;pen&#8221; for safe-cracking at the time
he landed the job with the Journal.
Theoretically all men should have
shunned him on account of his jailbird
taint. Not so Bland. The Chief was
independent in his ideas on the eternal
fitness of things and allowed none of
the ordinary conventions of humanity
to influence his decisions. So Jimmie
became one of the staff and worked
hard to justify Bland in hiring him.
His former profession gave him valuable
sidelights upon crime stories of
all kinds, and he was almost invariably
picked as the man to write these
up for the columns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie,&#8221; said the Chief, &#8220;we have
need of an experienced strong-arm man
and all around second story worker.
You are the only man on the force who
fills the bill for this job. Perry here
has just returned from Keegan, where
I sent him to interview Professor Kell.
Skip Handlon went with him, but
failed to return. We want to know
what happened to Skip. That is your
job. <i>Get Handlon!</i> If he is dead let
me know by long distance phone and
I&#8217;ll have a couple of headquarters men
down there in a hurry. Get a good
fast car and don&#8217;t waste any time.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Hara stopped long enough to get
the location of Professor Kell&#8217;s place
fixed in his mind, then abruptly departed.
Bland gazed after him musingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Professor will have some job
to put anything over on that bird,&#8221; he
said grimly. &#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m sorry
for the old soul.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">After</span> leaving the Journal office
Jimmie proceeded directly to a
certain stable where he kept his private
car. It was a long, low speedster
with a powerful engine, and capable
of eating up distance. It was the work
of a minute to touch the starter and
back out of the yard.</p>
<p>For the next hour he held the
wheel grimly while the car roared over
the seventy-odd miles to Keegan.
Would he be in time? At last a sign
post told him that he was within five
miles of the railroad crossing at Keegan.
Now the headlights were picking
out the black outlines of the freight
shed, and the next moment he had
swept over the tracks. The luminous
dial on his wrist watch notified him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
that he had been on the road but little
over an hour, but his spirits somehow
refused to revive with the knowledge.</p>
<p>About a mile beyond the station he
drove the car into a dark wood road
and parked it, turning off all lights.
The rest of the way to the Professor&#8217;s
mansion he did on foot. Rather than
approach from the front of the grounds
he nimbly climbed a stone wall and,
crossing a field or two, entered the
stretch of woods which extended just
behind the mansion. His pocket flashlight
here came into use, and once or
twice he gave a reassuring pat to a
rear pocket where bulged a heavy Colt
automatic.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">What</span> was that? He had approached
very close to the rear
of the house now. No lights were visible
as yet, but unless he was greatly
mistaken he had heard a muffled
scream. He stopped in his tracks and
listened intently. Again it came, this
time with a blood-curdling cadence
ending in what he would have sworn
was a choking sob.</p>
<p>The little job of getting the old-fashioned
rear window open was a
mere nothing to the experienced
O&#8217;Hara, and in a moment he was inside
the house. His feet struck soft carpet.
Catlike, he stepped to one side in order
to prevent any hidden eyes from perceiving
his form silhouetted in the dim
light of the open window. He dared
not use his flashlight for fear that the
circle of light would betray his position,
thus making him an excellent target
for possible bullets. Following the
wall closely he managed to circle the
room without mishap. His searching
fingers finally came in contact with a
door frame, and he breathed a sigh of
relief. Here there was nothing to bar
his progress except some moth-eaten
portieres. These he brushed aside.</p>
<p>The room which he now entered was
probably the same into which the Professor
had ushered Handlon and Perry
the day before. There being still no
sign of life about, the reporter decided
to throw caution to the winds. He
brought his flash into play. Quickly
casting the powerful beam around the
chamber he examined the place with
an all-searching glance.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Nothing.</span></p>
<p>With a stifled oath he turned
his attention to the other rooms in the
immediate vicinity. The brilliant light
revealed not the slightest trace of a
person, living or dead. The sound
must have come from the second story
or from the cellar. He decided on the
upper floor.</p>
<p>Feverish with impatience because of
the valuable time he had already lost,
he bounded up the heavily carpeted
stairs two at a time. Now to his keen
ears came certain faint sounds which
told him that he was on the right track.
Before him extended a long, dusty hall,
terminating in a single heavy door.
Several other doors opened at intervals
along the corridor. One or two
of these were open, and he threw the
beam from his flash hastily into one
after another of them. He saw only
dusty and mildewed chamber furnishings
of an ancient massive style.</p>
<p>Suddenly he pricked up his ears.</p>
<p>The door ahead of him was creaking
slowly open. Instantly he extinguished
his torch and leaped into the nearest
room. Whoever was opening that end
door was carrying a lamp. What if
the Professor had accomplices who
might discover him and overpower him
by force of numbers! O&#8217;Hara drew
the automatic from his pocket, deriving
a comforting assurance from the
feel of the cold steel. Here was something
no man could resist could he but
get it into action. The light was now
nearly abreast of his door, and for a
sickening instant he thought the
prowler was coming into the room. He
held his breath. Now the lamp was at
the open door, and now it was quickly
withdrawn. After a breathless second
he tip-toed forward and peered cautiously
down the hallway.</p>
<p>About here it was that James O&#8217;Hara
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
began to realize that this was going to
be a horrible night indeed. He had
wondered why the progress of the light
had been so deathly slow. Now he
knew why, by reason of what he saw&ndash;&ndash;and
what he saw made him feel rather
sick. The man with the lantern was
quite plainly Professor Kell, bent nearly
double with the weight of a grotesquely
big thing on his back, a thing
that flung a dim, contorted shadow on
the ceiling. And that thing was a dead
man.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A corpse</span> it was&ndash;&ndash;the attitude
proved that. With a numb relief
O&#8217;Hara realized it was not the
body of Skip Handlon. This had been
a much larger man than Skip, and the
clothing was different from anything
Handlon had worn.</p>
<p>The light was now disappearing
down the stairway. For a moment
O&#8217;Hara felt undecided as to his next
move. Should he follow Kell and his
burden, or should he not take advantage
of this fine opportunity to continue
his search of the upper story?
That scream still rang in his ears;
there had been a very evident feminine
quality in it, and the remembrance of
that fact reproached him. Had he been
guilty of mincing daintily about in
this old house while a woman was being
done to death under his nose, when
a little bolder action on his part might
have saved her?</p>
<p>Stepping once more into the hall he
advanced to the door just closed behind
the Professor and tried it, only
to find it locked. Out of a pocket came
several articles best known to the &#8220;profession&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a
piece of stiff wire, a skeleton
key and other paraphernalia calculated
to reduce the obstinate mechanism
to submission. For a minute, two,
three, he worked at the ancient lock;
then, without a creak, the door swung
open. A touch of oil to the hinges had
insured their silence. Jimmie O&#8217;Hara
believed in being artistic in his work,
especially when it came to fine points,
and he was.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> found himself in the same
room where the drugged cigars
had been proved the undoing of Handlon
and Perry. In order not to alarm
the Professor unduly by chance noises
and perhaps invite a surprise attack
upon himself, O&#8217;Hara closed the laboratory
door behind him and let the
lock spring again. Hastily he made
search of the place. No trace of the
missing reporter could he find, except
two half-consumed cigars in a corner
whence the Professor had impatiently
kicked them.</p>
<p>On the big table in the center of the
room, however, was an object which
excited his interest. It was apparently
nothing more or less than a giant
Crookes tube, connected in some way
with a complicated mechanism contained
in a wooden cabinet under the
table. Probably this apparatus was
concerned in the Professor&#8217;s weird experiments
which had so aroused the
countryside. He studied it curiously,
his eyes for the moment closed in
thought, until a slight sound somewhere
near at hand caused him to open
them wide. Was the Kell returning?</p>
<p>Quickly he extinguished the lamp
and glided to a nearby door, thinking
to secrete himself here, and take Kell
by surprise. To his consternation the
door swung inward at a touch. He
prepared instinctively for battle
against any foe who might present
himself. For a moment he held himself
taut; then, nothing of an alarming
nature having happened, he drew a
swift breath of relief and flashed on
his light. He gave vent to a low exclamation.
The swiftly darting shaft
from the torch had revealed the figure
of a girl, bound and gagged.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> girl lay trembling on a
wretched bed in a corner of the
dilapidated old chamber. O&#8217;Hara
crossed the room and bent over her.
Still wary of a trap he glanced back in
the direction of the laboratory door:
all safe there. Jimmie made haste to
remove the cruel gag from her mouth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Courage,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Half a
minute and you will be free.&#8221;</p>
<p>He produced a knife with a suspiciously
long blade and cut her bonds.
He then assisted her to her feet, where
she reeled dizzily. Realizing the need
for fast action he made her sit down
while he massaged the bruised arms
and ankles, which were badly swollen
from the tight ropes. The girl had apparently
been in the grip of such terrible
fright that she had temporarily
lost her power of speech. Mentally he
chalked up another score against the
Professor as the girl made several ineffectual
attempts to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, kid,&#8221; Jimmie whispered.
&#8220;Just sit tight, and when you feel able
you can tell me all about it. I&#8217;m going
to get him good for this, you can bank
on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thanked him with a faint smile,
and of a sudden she found her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you? Where is father?
Oh, tell me, please! I am afraid that
horrible man has murdered him. Are
you a servant here? Oh, I don&#8217;t know
whom to trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Jimmie O&#8217;Hara,&#8221; replied
the reporter briefly; &#8220;and I hope
you won&#8217;t worry about me. I am gunning
for the Proff myself. Tell me as
quickly as you can what you know
about him.&#8221; He still kept an eye on
the door of the adjoining laboratory.
Any moment he expected to hear the
sound of the old man&#8217;s approach. The
room would make an ideal place to ambush
the maniac, he had swiftly decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Norma Manion. Please don&#8217;t
delay, but see if you can locate
father.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice was agonized.
&#8220;I heard him groan a half-hour ago,
and a little later came a terrific crash.
Oh, I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s dead!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Reluctantly</span> Jimmie gave up
the idea of ambushing the Professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait here,&#8221; he commanded curtly.
&#8220;If you hear a shot join me as soon as
you can. I want to take him alive if
I can, but....&#8221; With this parting
hint he disappeared through the door
into the laboratory. Down the carpeted
hall he crept to the stairway.
Here he stopped and listened, but to
his sensitive ears came no sound from
below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have gone down the cellar
with the body,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Here
goes for a general exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>With more boldness than the occasion
perhaps really justified he descended
the stairs and proceeded to
examine the ground floor rooms minutely.
The first was the room through
which he had made entrance to the
house. It proved to be but a storeroom
containing nothing of interest,
and he soon decided to waste no more
time on it.</p>
<p>The adjoining chamber, however,
yielded some surprising finds. He had
pushed back a dusty portiere to find
himself in what could be nothing less
than the Professor&#8217;s sleeping chamber.
At present the bed was unoccupied,
though it showed signs of recent use.
The electric torch played swiftly over
every possible corner which could constitute
a hiding place for an assassin,
revealing nothing. Now the ever-searching
ray fell upon an old-fashioned
dresser, on which was piled a
miscellaneous array of articles. Here
were combs, brushes, a wig, a huge
magnifying glass, and a gold watch.
With a barely suppressed exclamation,
Jimmie pounced upon the gold timepiece.</p>
<p>Handlon&#8217;s! So well did he know the
particular design of his watch that he
could have recognized it in the dark
by sense of touch alone. So the old
man was not averse to robbery among
his other activities! The former two-story
man thought fast. Handlon had
probably been done in, and the body
had been disposed of in some weird
manner. The only thing that remained
to be done, since the unlucky photographer
was evidently past human help,
was to cut short the Professor&#8217;s list of
murders.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">With</span> the intention of missing
no essential detail O&#8217;Hara
swept the ray of the searchlight around
the chamber once more, but discovered
no more of importance. Deciding that
the sleeping chamber could yield no
further clue he shut off the tell-tale
ray and stepped noiselessly back into
the next room. Here he groped his
way around until he encountered a
door, which stood open. A moment&#8217;s
cautious exploration with an outstretched
foot revealed the top step of
a descending staircase. No faintest
glimmer of light was visible, but muffled
sounds proceeding from the depths
told him that someone was below.</p>
<p>With infinite care, feeling his way
gingerly over the rickety old steps and
fearful that an unexpected creak from
one of the ancient boards would at any
moment prove his undoing, he commenced
the descent. Once a board did
groan softly, causing him to stop in his
tracks and stand with bated breath. He
listened for sign of a movement below,
while his heart loudly told off a dozen
strokes. Stealthily he continued his
progress, until finally soft earth under
his feet told him he had reached the
cellar bottom.</p>
<p>Now his straining eyes perceived a
tiny bit of light, and simultaneously
he became conscious of a deathly
stench. The damp earth padding his
footsteps, he advanced swiftly toward
the source of light, which now seemed
to lie in stripes across his line of vision.
He soon saw that the stairs gave
upon a small boarded-off section of
the cellar proper, and light was seeping
between the boards. Ah, and here was
a rickety door, fortuitously equipped
with a large knot-hole. O&#8217;Hara applied
an eye to this&ndash;&ndash;and what he saw
nearly ruined even his cast iron nerve.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> Professor was working beside
a heavy wooden cask, from which
issued the horrible stench. From time
to time a sodden thud told that he was
hacking something to pieces with an
ax. Now and then he would strain
mightily at a dark and bulky thing
which lay on the floor, a thing that required
considerable strength to lift. It
seemed to be getting lighter after each
spasm of frenzied chopping. For a
second Kell&#8217;s shadow wavered away
from the thing, and the enervated
newspaper man saw it plainly. His
senses almost left him as he realized
that he was witnessing the dismemberment
of a human body.</p>
<p>As he hacked the fragments of tissue
from the torso the fiend carefully
deposited each in the huge cask. At
such times a faint boiling sound was
heard, and there arose an effluvium
that bade fair to overcome even the
monster engaged in the foul work. At
last the limbs and head had been entirely
removed. The Professor evidently
decided that the trunk should
be left whole, and he put his entire
strength into the job of getting it into
the cask. It was almost more than he
could negotiate, but finally a dull
splash told that he had succeeded.</p>
<p>At this moment Jimmie O&#8217;Hara came
out of his trance. The horrible proceeding
had left him faint and shaken,
and he wished heartily that he could
leave the disgusting place as fast as
his legs could carry him. But there
was still work to be done and he resolved
to get it over.</p>
<p>The lantern! First he must put that
out of commission. The maniac would
then be at his mercy. Slowly, steadily
he stole through the doorway, his eyes
glued to the Professor&#8217;s back. Now
he was within a yard of the lantern,
and he drew back his foot for the kick.</p>
<p>Next moment Jimmie found himself
gazing into the glaring eyes of his intended
victim. Instinctively he struck
out with the clubbed automatic, but
the blow must have fallen short, or else
the Professor had developed an uncanny
agility. Now to his horror he saw
the flashing blade of the bloodstained
ax raised on high. He had no time to
dodge the blow. He pressed the trigger
of the Colt from the position in
which he held it.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> bullet grazed the upraised
arm. The ax fell toward O&#8217;Hara
from fingers lacking strength to retain
it, and he grasped it by the handle in
midair. The next moment the assassin
collected his wits and sprang at him.
Silently, the breath of both coming in
gasps, the two men strove, each clawing
desperately at the other&#8217;s throat.
The reporter fought with the knowledge
that should he lose he would
never again see the light of day, the
other with the fear of the justice that
would deal with him.</p>
<p>The maniac hugged his arms tightly
about Jimmie, pinioning him so tightly
that the reporter could not use his gun.
At length their convulsive movements
brought the men close to the lantern,
and the next instant the cellar was
plunged in darkness. A second later
the Professor tripped over some hidden
obstruction and fell, dragging his
opponent with him to the earthen floor.
To Jimmie&#8217;s surprise there was no
further movement from the body beneath
him. Could the old <a name='TC_22'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'villian'">villain</ins> be
playing possum? He cautiously shifted
his hold and grasped the hidden throat.
He pressed the Professor&#8217;s windpipe
for a moment, but there was no answering
struggle. Slowly the truth
dawned upon him. The heavy fall to
the floor had rendered the older man
insensible.</p>
<p>He must work fast. Reaching into
his pocket he brought out the ever
handy electric torch and flashed it over
the features of his prisoner. Kell was
breathing heavily. With dexterous
<a name='TC_47'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Removed 'the'">hands O&#8217;Hara</ins> swiftly went through
the old man&#8217;s pockets, removing all
which might tend to make that worthy
dangerous&ndash;&ndash;an ugly looking pistol of
large caliber, a blackjack <a name='TC_23'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'similiar'">similar</ins> to
his own and a small bottle.</p>
<p>The latter item Jimmie examined
curiously, finally uncorking it and inhaling
the contents. He inhaled, not
wisely but too well. The fumes from
the vial were nigh overpowering, and
he reeled back nauseated. The cork he
hastily replaced. Just what the nature
of the powerful stuff was he never attempted
to discover. One acquaintance was enough.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> staggered to his feet and got
the lantern lighted, then sat, gun
in hand, waiting for his prisoner&#8217;s return
to his senses. This was becoming
increasingly imminent, judging by certain
changes in the Professor&#8217;s respiration.
Finally there came a series of
shuddering movements as the man attempted
to raise his battered body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, you damned butcher,&#8221; ordered
Jimmie, &#8220;and march upstairs.
And just remember that I&#8217;ve got you
covered; don&#8217;t make any false moves.&#8221;
He prodded the prostrate form of the
by now glaring fiend before him. The
stench of the place was nearly overcoming
him, and again he felt an overwhelming
desire to dash madly from
that den of evil, and once more breathe
God&#8217;s fresh air. Under the stimulus
of several shoves the Professor finally
won to his feet and stumbled up the
stairs. Jimmie was taking no chances
and kept the automatic sharply digging
into the ribs of his prisoner. The
fight, however, seemed temporarily to
have been all taken out of the old man,
and he made no resistance as the reporter
drove him on up to the laboratory.</p>
<p>The room he found exactly as he
left it. At a word from him Norma
Manion came from her hiding place in
the horrible room where she had been
kept prisoner.</p>
<p>With an hysterical scream she fell
limply to the floor. The sight of her
father&#8217;s murderer had proved too much
for her. Forgetting his prisoner for
the moment Jimmie sprang to the girl&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>Kell chose this moment to make a
dash for freedom. His footsteps, however,
were not as noiseless as he had
intended, and O&#8217;Hara whirled just in
time to see his quarry about to throw
open the hall door. Jimmie dove for
his gun, only to encounter the Professor&#8217;s
mysterious vial, which, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
forgotten, still lay in his pocket. With
no time to think, he acted purely upon
instinct. His arm drew back and the
bottle flew straight for the Professor&#8217;s
head.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">By</span> a miracle the missile missed
its mark. Came a shivering
crash, as the bottle struck a stud in
the massive door. Of a sudden recalling
the terrific potency of the contents
of that particular bottle, Jimmie
gasped in dismay. Norma Manion&#8217;s
safety drove every other thought from
his mind. At any cost he must remove
her from the proximity of those lethal
fumes.</p>
<p>Hastily and without a backward
glance, he gathered the girl into his
arms and dashed into the room where
he had first found her. Ascertaining
that she had but swooned he placed
her gently on the bed. In some perplexity
as to his next move he stared
at the beautiful face now so wan and
white. Queer that he hadn&#8217;t noticed
the fact before&ndash;&ndash;she was beautiful. He
even took a second look, then noting a
continued absence of all sound from
the laboratory decided to investigate.</p>
<p>Gingerly he pushed open the door,
sniffing the air cautiously as he advanced.
To his nostrils gradually came
a slight scent, which though almost
imperceptible made his senses reel. As
he approached the hall door he found
the atmosphere heavy with the soporific
vapors from the broken vial, and
he staggered drunkenly.</p>
<p>He gave a start of surprise. On the
floor, lying in a grotesque huddle
which suggested a most unpleasant possibility,
was the inert body of Professor
Kell.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Jimmie</span> bent over the body and put
an experienced ear to the heart.
Yes, there as a faint beat&ndash;&ndash;very faint.
Even as he listened he perceived a
slight increase in the respiration. Now
the breath began coming in great, choking
gasps, only to die suddenly to next
to nothing. At last with a rueful sigh
Jimmie reached to his hip and produced
the private O&#8217;Hara flagon. He
stooped over the Professor&#8217;s form once
more and by dint of much prying at
clenched jaws managed to force a sizeable
charge of fiery liquid down the
old man&#8217;s throat. Jimmie had just begun
to entertain a strong hope that
this latter effort would bring the Professor
to life, when his keen ear detected
signs of a commotion below.</p>
<p>He sprang from his position over the
slowly reviving Kell and leaped to a
vantage point beside the door. A
blackjack miraculously appeared from
some hidden part of his anatomy and
the ever-dependable Colt also became
in evidence. Now came the banging
of a door, muffled voices, a crash as of
a chair overturned in the dark. Up
rolled a horrible oath, and the same
was rendered in a voice to Jimmie
sweetly familiar. Came the sound of
footsteps on the stairway and several
persons coming along the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where in hell is Jimmie?&#8221; roared a
wicked voice. &#8220;If he&#8217;s met with any
monkey business in this hell-hole I&#8217;ll
see that the damned place burns to
the ground before I leave it!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Delightedly</span> Jimmie jerked
open the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still alive, Chief,&#8221; he chirped as
the Old Man strode into the laboratory.
Bland was followed by Perry, who
seemed to be in a sort of daze. Bringing
up the rear were a pair of plainclothesmen
whom Jimmie knew very
well&ndash;&ndash;almost too well. One of these
gentlemen bore a lantern which reminded
Jimmie strongly of some he
had seen that night guarding an open
ditch in the public highway.</p>
<p>The Professor had fully regained
consciousness and was struggling to
his feet. As for Norma Manion, she
had suddenly appeared, leaning weakly
against the door casing, and was surveying
the group in great alarm.</p>
<p>After being assured by O&#8217;Hara that
they were her friends she smiled wanly.
To Bland and the others she was,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
of course, an unexpected factor in the
weird night&#8217;s doings, and for several
moments they regarded her curiously.</p>
<p>At length Jimmie, sensing the question
in the Old Man&#8217;s eyes, elected to
offer a few words of explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Manion has just been through
a terrible experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She
and her father have been for some time
at the mercy of this monster&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;indicating
Kell&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and her nerves are completely
shattered. We&#8217;d better get her
out of this as quickly as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike!&#8221; Hard Boiled Bland glared
at one of the officers. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stand
there with your teeth in your gums
like that. Take this girl out to my
car and let her lie down. She needs
a stimulant, too. If you search my car
and find <a name='TC_24'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'and'">any</ins> red liquor in the left back
door pocket, I don&#8217;t know a thing about
it. And stay with her so she won&#8217;t be
afraid to go to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled in silent gratitude and
allowed the plainclothesman to lead
her away from that chamber of horror.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> reporter lost no time in telling
Bland of his failure to find
Skip Handlon. He went on to acquaint
his Chief with the facts of all
that had occured while he had been at
the Professor&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>The fiery old fellow listened grimly.
When Jimmie came to the story of the
corpse and the cask the editor breathed
one word, &#8220;Manion!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie nodded sadly. All eyes
turned to the dejected huddle on the
floor that was Professor Kell. Finally
Bland could wait no longer, but fixed
a terrible eye on the murderer and demanded
harshly, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Handlon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the Professor burst into a fit
of insane laughter, laughter that curdled
the blood of the listeners.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ask me that! It&#8217;s almost too
good. Hee-hee! You sent your two
precious reporters out to my house to
pry into my secrets, and thought to display
my name all over your yellow
sheet; but you forgot that you were
dealing with Professor Anton Kell,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; The last he fairly
shrieked. &#8220;A lot of people have tried
to intrude upon me before, but none
ever escaped me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that,&#8221; cut in Jimmie, for
he was getting impatient and the old
man&#8217;s boastings seemed out of place.
&#8220;You are slated for the rope anyway,
after what I discovered down cellar.&#8221;
He jerked his eyes in the direction of
the door significantly. &#8220;Now we propose
to find Handlon, and the better it
will be for you if you tell us what you
have done with him. Otherwise....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go to hell!&#8221; screamed the
maniac. &#8220;If you are so clever, find out
for yourselves. He isn&#8217;t so far away
that you couldn&#8217;t touch him by reaching
out your hand. In fact, he&#8217;s been
with you quite a while. Hee-hee-hee!
Well, if you must know&ndash;&ndash;there he is!&#8221;
With an insane chuckle he pointed at
Horace Perry. And Perry did a strange
thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you fiend, here I am!&#8221; Whose
voice was that? Was it Perry speaking,
or was it Skip Handlon? Most
assuredly Perry stood before them, but
the voice, in a subtle manner, reminded
the group strongly of poor old Skip.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">As</span> he spoke Perry had launched
himself at the Professor&#8217;s throat
and had to be restrained by the others.
Savagely he fought them but slowly
and surely they overcame his struggles
and placed him, writhing, in a chair.</p>
<p>Of a sudden Bland leaned forward
and scrutinized Perry&#8217;s face sharply.
Had the reporter gone insane too? The
pupils of the eyes had taken on a sort
of queer contraction, a fixed quality
that was almost ludicrous. He looked
like a man under hypnosis. He had
gone limp in their grasp, but now suddenly
he stiffened. The eyes underwent
another startling change, this
time glowing undoubtedly with the
look of reason. Bland was mystified
and waited for Perry to explain his
queer conduct. The latter seemed
finally to come to. Simultaneously he
realized that his peculiar lapse from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
consciousness had been observed by the
others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I may as well admit it,&#8221; he
said with a wry smile. &#8220;Ever since I
came back from my assignment with
Kell I have had a hell of a time. Half
the time I have been in a daze and
have not had the least idea what I was
doing. Funny part of it is that I have
seemed to keep right on doing things
even while I was out of my head.&#8221; He
told briefly of the visions he had had
in which he had seemed to contend
with his brother reporter, the horrid
sensations as he felt himself overcome,
the black oblivion in which he then
found himself, and the mysterious
manner in which he had left Keegan
on that ill-fated assignment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done to Handlon?&#8221;
Jimmie&#8217;s voice cut in. He was standing
over the form of the maniac, rigid
and menacing. &#8220;You have exactly two
minutes to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find out for yourself!&#8221; snarled the
bruised and battered fiend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; was the answer, and on the
instant a horrible shriek rent the air.
Jimmie had quickly grasped both of
the Professor&#8217;s arms at the wrists and
was slowly twisting them in a grip of
iron. Kell&#8217;s face went white, the lips
writhed back over toothless gums, the
eyes closed in the supreme effort to
withstand the excruciating pain.
Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough, enough!&#8221; he screamed.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">O&#8217;Hara</span> eased the pressure slightly
but retained his hold upon the
clawlike hands. &#8220;Talk fast,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>The old man struggled futilely in
the grasp of the powerful reporter,
finally glancing in the direction of the
others. Would they show signs of
pity? Surely not Hard Boiled Bland.
The Chief was watching the struggles
of the victim through a cloud of
tobacco smoke which he was slowly
exhaling through his nose. The plainclothesman
displayed no sign of interest
at all. The game was up!</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said sullenly.
&#8220;Handlon and Perry are both occupying
the same body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-a-a-t?&#8221; roared Bland. &#8220;Jimmie,
I guess you&#8217;ll have to put the screws to
him some more. He&#8217;s trying to make
fools of us at the last minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; screamed the Professor.
&#8220;What I say is true. I have been working
for years on my system of de-astralization.
This last year I at length
perfected my electric de-astralizer,
which amplifies and exerts the fifth influence
of de-cohesion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole party began to look uneasy
and gazed apprehensively at the
huge Crookes tube which still stood in
its supporting frame on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been forced to experiment on
animals for the most part,&#8221; the Professor
continued. &#8220;I succeeded in de-astralizing
a dog and a bull and caused
them to exchange bodies. The bodies
continued to function. I was enthusiastic.
Other experiments took place
of which I will not tell you. Finally
I began to long for a human subject on
which to try my fifth influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just get down to cases, if you don&#8217;t
mind, Kell.&#8221; The Chief wanted action.
&#8220;Suppose you tell us just what you did
to Handlon and where we can find him.
I may as well mention that your life
depends upon it. If we find that you
have done for him, something worse
than death may happen to you.&#8221; The
tone was menacing. Although Handlon
was a comparatively late acquisition
to the old Chief&#8217;s staff, still he had
been loyal to the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your two damned reporters
entered my driveway,&#8221; Kell resumed.
&#8220;I saw them coming through a powerful
glass which I always have on hand.
I had no desire to see them, but they
forced themselves upon me. At last I
determined that they should furnish
material for my experiments.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">I</span><span class="dcap">f</span> your men had looked into the
grove behind the barn they would
have found the automobile which furnished
two more subjects I was keeping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
on hand in a room upstairs. Old
Manion and his daughter gave me quite
a bit of trouble, but I kept them
drugged most of the time. He broke
out of the room to-night though, and I
had to kill him. It was self defense,&#8221;
he added slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I found it was possible to
make two astrals exchange bodies. But
I also wanted to see if it were possible
to cause two astrals to occupy the same
body at the same time, and if so what
the result would be. I found out. It
was rare sport to watch your star reporter
leave my house. He was damned
glad to leave, I believe....&#8221; Again
came the insane cackle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we have to believe him
whether we want to or not.&#8221; The detective
came to life. &#8220;How about making
him release Handlon&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;what d&#8217;ye
call it?&ndash;&ndash;astral&ndash;&ndash;from Perry&#8217;s body?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment.&#8221; The voice now
was unmistakably Handlon&#8217;s, though it
was issuing from the throat of Perry.
&#8220;In the minute I have in consciousness
let me suggest that before you do any
more de-astralizing you <i>locate my
body</i>. Until then, if I am released
from this one I am a dead man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words struck the group dumb.
Where <i>was</i> Handlon&#8217;s body? Could
the Professor produce it?</p>
<p>That worthy looked rather haunted
at that moment, and they began to see
the fear of death coming upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, mercy!&#8221; he begged as the
four men started to advance upon him.
&#8220;As soon as I had de-astralized Handlon
I destroyed his body in my pickling
barrel down cellar. But there is
another way....&#8221; He paused, uncertain
as to how his next words would be
received. &#8220;Go out and get the Manion
girl. She can be de-astralized and
friend Handlon can have her body.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">At</span> this suggestion, advanced so
na&iuml;vely, the four men recoiled in
horror. It was entirely too much even
for Hard Boiled Bland, and he could
hardly restrain himself from applying
the editorial fist to the leering face before
him. Undoubtedly Professor Kell
was hopelessly insane, and for that reason
he held himself in leash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kell, you are slated to pull off one
more stunt,&#8221; Jimmie addressed the
cringing heap. &#8220;You know what it is.
Get busy. And just remember that I
am standing over here&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he indicated
a corner well separated from the rest&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;with
this cannon aimed in your direction.
If things aren&#8217;t just according to
Hoyle, you get plugged. Get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it, men?&#8221; Bland spoke
up. &#8220;Is it going to be treating Handlon
right to de-astralize him now? It
will be his last chance to have a body
on this earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately that body never belonged
to Handlon,&#8221; said O&#8217;Hara.
&#8220;Hence I fail to see why Perry should
be discommoded for the balance of his
life with a companion astral. Perry is
clearly entitled to his own body, free
and unhampered. Friend Skip is out
of luck, unless&ndash;&ndash;Well, I don&#8217;t mind
telling you, Kell, that you just gave
me an idea. Snap into it now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Professor dragged himself to his
feet and under the menace of the automatic
fumbled under the table until he
had located the intricate apparatus before
mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if Mr. Perry&ndash;&ndash;or Handlon&ndash;&ndash;will
kindly recline at full length on
this table,&#8221; he said with an obscene
leer, &#8220;the experiment will begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just remember, Kell, this is no experiment,&#8221;
advised Bland, fixing the
Professor with an ugly eye. &#8220;You do
as you&#8217;re told.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other made no reply, but threw
a hidden switch. Perry, lying flat on
his back on the ancient table, suddenly
found himself being bathed by what
seemed to be a ray of light, and yet was
not a ray of light. What was it? It
was surely not visible, yet it was tangible.
A terrific force was emanating
from that devilish globe above him,
drawing him out of himself&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;was
he expanding? Again his ears became
filled with confused, horrible
sounds, the outlines of the room faded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
from sight, he felt a strange sense of
inflation ... of lightness.... Oblivion!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">From</span> where the others sat a gasp
of wonder went up. At the first
contact of the switch there had been a
momentary flash of greenish light
within the bulb, and then a swift
transition to a beautiful orange. It had
then faded altogether, leaving the
glass apparently inert and inactive.</p>
<p>But it was not so! The form lying
beneath the bulb was evidently being
racked with untold tortures. The face
became a thing of horror. Now it had
twisted into a grotesque semblance of
Handlon&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;now it again resembled
Perry&#8217;s. The Professor quietly increased
the pressure of the current.
From the bulb emanated a steel gray
exhalation of what must be termed
light, and yet so real it was seemingly
material. Assuredly it was not a ray of
light as we understand light. It came
in great beating throbs, in which the
actual vibrations were entirely visible.
Under each impact the body of Perry
seemed to change, slowly at first, then
with increasing speed. The body was
now swelled to enormous size. Bland
reached forward to touch it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This de-cohering influence,&#8221; the
Professor was murmuring, almost
raptly, &#8220;causes the atoms that go to
make a living body repel one another.
When the body is sufficiently nebulized,
the soul&ndash;&ndash;Back! Back, you
fool!&#8221; he suddenly shrieked, grasping
Bland by the arm. &#8220;Do you want to
kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bland hurriedly retreated, convinced
perforce that Kell&#8217;s alarm was genuine.
The editorial fingers had penetrated
the subject&#8217;s garments without
resistance and sank into the body as
easily as if it were so much soft soap!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> body continued to expand until
at length even the hard-headed
plainclothesman realized that it had
been reduced to a mere vapor. Within
this horrid vaporized body, which
nearly filled the room and which had
now lost all semblance to a man, could
be discerned two faint shapes. Swiftly
the Professor extinguished the lantern.
The shapes, vague though they were,
could be recognized as those of Horace
Perry and Skip <a name='TC_48'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Hanlon'">Handlon</ins>. And they
were at strife!</p>
<p>All eyes were now <a name='TC_6'></a><ins title="Was 'focussed'">focused</ins> on Professor
Kell, who was evidently waiting
for something to happen. The two apparitions
within the body-cloud were
at death grips. One had been overcome
and was temporarily helpless. It was
that of Handlon. And then again the
astral of Perry forcibly ousted that of
Handlon from the cloud-cyst. And at
that instant Professor Kell shut off the
influence-tube.</p>
<p>At once a terrific metamorphosis
took place. There came a sharp sound
almost like a clap of thunder, with the
slight exception that this was occasioned
by exactly the reverse effect.
Instead of being an <i>ex</i>plosion it might
more properly be termed an <i>in</i>plosion,
for the mist-cloud suddenly vanished.
The de-cohering influence having been
removed, the cloud had condensed into
the form of Perry. Apparently none
the worse, he was even now beginning
to recover consciousness. The astral
of Handlon was no longer visible,
though hovering in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Perry&#8217;s body was again his own.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">At</span> this time Jimmie O&#8217;Hara elected
to start something new by hitting
the Professor a workmanlike blow on
the back of the head with the butt of
his automatic. The next thing Bland
or anyone else present knew the unconscious
body of the Professor was on
the table and Jimmie was groping for
the concealed switch. At length he
found it, and the green flash of light
appeared in the bulb, followed by the
brilliant orange manifestation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in hell are you doing?&#8221;
gasped Bland.</p>
<p>&#8220;De-astralizing the Professor,&#8221; replied
O&#8217;Hara cheerfully. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
get the idea yet? Watch!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></div>
<p>Fascinated, the four men saw the terrific
emanation take its baleful effect.
As before, the body commenced to expand
and gradually took on a misty
outline. Larger and larger it grew, until
finally it had become a vast cloud
of intangible nothingness which filled
the room like some evil nebula.</p>
<p>A cry of consternation from the detective
aroused Jimmie. Skip Handlon&#8217;s
astral had appeared within the
field of the nebula to fight for possession.
There ensued what was perhaps
the weirdest encounter ever witnessed.
Though he was in poor physical shape,
the Professor seemed to have an extremely
powerful astral; and for some
time the spectators despaired of Handlon&#8217;s
victory. Once the latter, evidently
realizing that the powerful influence
tube had rendered him visible,
glanced sharply in Jimmie&#8217;s direction.
O&#8217;Hara was considerably puzzled at
this, but watched the progress of the
struggle tensely. At length the moment
seemed to arrive which the reporter&#8217;s
astral had been awaiting. It
turned tail and fled away from the
astral of the Professor, disappearing
beyond the outer confines of the
nebula.</p>
<p>Jimmie suddenly divined the other&#8217;s
purpose and dived for the hidden
switch. As he had anticipated, Handlon
had finally given up the attempt to
overcome the astral of Kell by force
and had made up his mind to accomplish
his end by strategy. Almost on
the instant that Jimmie&#8217;s hand closed
on the switch the reporter&#8217;s astral
again leaped into the field of the nebula.
Fiercely it signalled to the former
second story man to shut off the current,
but the admonition was unnecessary,
for Jimmie had already done so.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Swiftly</span> the cloud-cyst faded.
Even as the group caught a fleeting
sight of Skip Handlon, the last that
mortal eyes would ever see of him as
he actually was, there came a violent
disturbance at the edge of the shrinking
nebula. Would the speed of condensation
of the atoms which comprised
the body of Professor Kell serve
to shut out the pursuing astral of Kell?</p>
<p>Even Bland held his breath!</p>
<p>The cloud lost its luminous quality,
the action of condensation increasing
in speed. It was barely visible in the
enshrouding gloom. An astral had
long since been enveloped within the
rapidly accumulating substance. Came
a sudden clap of sound as before, and
the final act of resolution had been accomplished.
Whether the Professor
had succeeded in regaining a position
within the cloud-cyst before the crucial
second none could say.</p>
<p>Jimmie relighted the lantern. Apparently
the effect of the love tap administered
by his automatic was more
or less of a lasting character, and the
men were put to some ado to restore
the body of Kell to consciousness. At
length their efforts began to bear fruit,
however, and it became expedient to
remove the patient to the softer couch
in the sitting room below. As they
moved forward to lay hold of the limp
body a figure appeared in the doorway
to the hall. It was the plainclothesman,
Riley.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about getting under way for
town,&#8221; he wanted to know. &#8220;Is the old
party croaked yet? Miss Manion has
had a fierce time and says she won&#8217;t
stay near this house another minute.
I don&#8217;t like this place myself either.
Do you know I just got kicked by a
poll parrot? Let&#8217;s get away from
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Riley, what are you talking
about?&#8221; growled Bland. &#8220;Kicked
by a poll parrot! You&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Chief,&#8221; broke in the
now thoroughly cheerful Perry. &#8220;That
jackass I shot could probably have told
us all about it. I positively know the
beast could talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; snorted Bland, &#8220;Well, if
a donkey can talk, and a bull can bite,
and a hound can hook, why shouldn&#8217;t
a parrot&ndash;&ndash;Judas Priest, I&#8217;m getting as
crazy as the rest of you! Hurry up
and get <a name='TC_25'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Kel'">Kell</ins> downstairs so we can see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
who he is. There I go again! Oh, go
lie down, Riley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look, Bland, look!&#8221; Riley was
pointing a demoralized finger at a cage
in the corner. He tugged frantically at
Bland&#8217;s coat sleeve. &#8220;See what&#8217;s in
there, won&#8217;t you? I&ndash;&ndash;well, I did find
some liquor in your car, and Miss
Manion made me take some. I&ndash;&ndash;I
didn&#8217;t know it would do this to me.
Look in there; please, Mr. Bland!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Bland</span> gave Riley a dark look,
but nevertheless he reached for
O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s flashlight. In the cage two
yellow eyes blinked sleepily out at him.
Perry began to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, there&#8217;s nothing in there but a
cat. Skip and I heard it purring when
we first came in here this afternoon.
Guess Riley&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great God, Jimmie, give me your
gun!&#8221; Hard Boiled Bland for the moment
failed to merit his sobriquet. The
torch in his hand threw a trembling
beam full into the cage. &#8220;It&#8217;s a snake!
And&ndash;&ndash;there! It&#8217;s doing it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>A snake it was, indubitably, a huge
black specimen with bright yellow
stripes. Bland&#8217;s frenzied yell seemed
not to have excited it at all, for now the
sleek fellow had arched its body neatly
and was calmly licking its sides with a
long forked tongue. After a moment it
halted the operation long enough to
rub its jaw against a bar of its cage,
and gave vent to a sociable mew!</p>
<p>Even this could not dash the spirits
of Horace Perry. He laughed delightedly
again as he laid Bland by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That creature is perfectly harmless,
Chief,&#8221; he told the editor. &#8220;Somewhere
I suppose there&#8217;s a mighty dangerous
kitty cat at large, but there&#8217;s no
sense in taking it out on this poor reptile.
Let&#8217;s live and let live.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a show of reluctance Bland returned
Jimmie&#8217;s automatic, then strode
over to where lay the form of Kell.
Perry and O&#8217;Hara lingered by the cage
long enough to arrange a plan to let the
snake out doors as soon as opportunity
offered, after which they joined their
Chief. Riley went out to resume his
vigil in Bland&#8217;s car, while his fellow
sleuth prepared to light the way downstairs.
Under his guidance the sick
man was carried below without mishap.</p>
<p>Downstairs the now conscious form
of the venerable Professor was laid out
on the ancient sofa until his senses
could clear a bit. Presently the eyelids
fluttered open and a feeble voice
asked, &#8220;Where the deuce am I, and how
did all you guys get here?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A joyous</span> gasp went up. That
voice! Although uttered in somewhat
the same vocal quality as Kell&#8217;s
the intonation and accents had strangely
altered. O&#8217;Hara leaned eagerly over
the figure on the couch. The question
he asked was startling in its incongruity:</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you feeling, <i>Skip</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<a name='TC_26'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Rotton'">Rotten</ins>,&#8221; was the reply from the lips
of Kell. &#8220;What hit me such a crack on
the dome? I feel as if I had been
dragged through a knot-hole. Lemme
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay still,&#8221; commanded O&#8217;Hara,
kindly but firmly. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t fit to
move yet. You are going on a long ride
and will need your strength. Don&#8217;t
talk, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>A half-hour later they left the house.
In the front yard the editor called a
hasty conclave which included the entire
party. Hard Boiled Bland has
never been known to talk so much at a
stretch, before or since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we start back,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;we had better come to an understanding.
In the first place&ndash;&ndash;Skip, come
over here a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norma Manion uttered an involuntary
cry of fear as the aged form of
Kell passed by her. Skip&#8217;s instant response
to his name had, of course, been
perfectly natural to him. But it had an
odd effect on the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Manion, and gentlemen,&#8221;
Bland went on, with a bow of mock
ceremony, &#8220;I want you to meet Mister&ndash;&ndash;er,
Mister&ndash;&ndash;oh hell, call him Saunders.
This is Mr. Kenneth Saunders,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
ladies and gentlemen. When he gets a
shave and has his new face patched up
I believe you will like his appearance
much more than you do now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously though, folks, I hope that
with a little fixing up the gentleman
will hardly resemble Professor Anton
Kell. Kell is dead. Obviously, however,
this gentleman can hardly continue
his existence as Skip Handlon.
Hence&ndash;&ndash;well, hence Mr. Saunders. And
don&#8217;t forget the name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now another little matter. This
house has proven a curse to humanity.
What has transpired here need never
be known. Would it not be the wiser
to eliminate all traces of to-night&#8217;s happenings?
There is a way.&#8221; He looked
significantly at the others.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">Y</span><span class="dcap">ou</span> mean&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Perry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That we destroy all traces of
Professor Kell&#8217;s villainy. Although he
is no more, still someone might notice
that <i>his body actively remains</i>. And no
one wants to do any explaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way we can protect
Handlon,&#8221; one of the sleuths ruminated,
half to himself. &#8220;No judge
would ever believe a word about this
de-astralization business. The chances
are we would all go to the booby hatch
and Handlon would go to prison for
Kell&#8217;s crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were four of us that witnessed
the fact of the&ndash;&ndash;the soul
transfusion, though,&#8221; Perry objected.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be enough to clear
Skip? Besides, wouldn&#8217;t it be possible
for us to lead a jury out here and duplicate
the experiment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much undesirable publicity,&#8221;
growled Bland, who for once in his life
had found reason to keep something
good out of the headlines. &#8220;What do
you say, people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I move we move,&#8221; from the detective
who had had the uncomfortable
job of attending to Norma Manion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentleman, I believe we understand
each other,&#8221; said Jimmie quietly.
&#8220;Now I am going into the barn&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;significantly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;to
see if everything&#8217;s all
right. While I am there something
<i>might</i> happen. You understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>The others nodded silent assent.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">In</span> the snug seat of Jimmie&#8217;s speedster
Norma Manion shivered as she
followed the direction indicated by her
companion&#8217;s finger. It was that darkest
hour which comes just before the
dawn.</p>
<p>To the westward could be perceived
a dull, red glow, which, even as they
watched with fascinated eyes, developed
into an intense glare. Gradually
the fading stars became eclipsed in the
greater glory.</p>
<p>Three cars, motors throbbing as if
eager to be gone, stood a space apart
on the main road. The car behind
O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s was the Manion machine, now
occupied by Bland and Riley. The remaining
one was a touring car and contained
the balance of the party. Perry
was at the wheel, and beside him sat
the Handlon-Kell-Saunders combination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus passes a den of horror,&#8221; whispered
Jimmie to his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the funeral pyre of my father,&#8221;
the girl answered simply. She had
long since recovered from her initial
outburst of grief at her loss, and now
watched the progress of the conflagration
dry-eyed. At length Jimmie
slipped an arm protectingly about the
trembling shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen enough,&#8221; he said. As
the three cars raced from the scene of
the holocaust, faint streamers in the
east told of the rising orb of day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Keegan, forever,&#8221; murmured
Norma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen,&#8221; O&#8217;Hara devoutedly agreed.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">From</span> somewhere out on the
black, heaving Atlantic, the
rapid, muffled popping of a
speed-boat&#8217;s exhaust drifted
clearly through the night.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>Man came from the sea. Mercer, by his
thought-telegraph, learns from the
weirdly beautiful ocean-maiden of a branch
that returned there.</p>
<p>I dropped my
book and stretched,
leaning back
more comfortably
in my chair.
There was real
romance and adventure! Rum-runners,
seeking out their hidden port with
their cargo of contraband from Cuba.
Heading fearlessly through the darkness,
fighting the high seas, still running
after the
storm of a day
or so before, daring
a thousand
dangers for the
sake of the straw-packed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
bottles they carried. Sea-bronzed
men, with hard, flat muscles
and fearless eyes; ready guns slapping
their thighs as they&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Absorbed in my mental picture of
these modern free-booters, the sudden
alarm of the telephone startled me like
an unexpected shot fired beside my ear.
Brushing the cigarette ashes from my
smoking-jacket, I crossed the room and
snatched up the receiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; I snapped ungraciously into
the mouthpiece. It was after eleven by
the ship&#8217;s clock on the mantel, and if&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Taylor?&#8221; The voice&ndash;&ndash;Warren Mercer&#8217;s
familiar voice&ndash;&ndash;rattled on without
waiting for a reply. &#8220;Get in your car
and come down here as fast as possible.
Come just as you are, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hat&#8217;s</span> the matter?&#8221; I managed
to interrupt him. &#8220;Burglars?&#8221;
I had never heard Mercer
speak in that high-pitched, excited
voice before; his usual speech was slow
and thoughtful, almost didactic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Taylor, don&#8217;t waste time
questioning me. If it weren&#8217;t urgent, I
wouldn&#8217;t be calling you, you know.
Will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; I said quickly, feeling
rather a fool for ragging him when he
was in such deadly earnest. &#8220;Have&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The receiver snapped and crackled;
Mercer had hung up the instant he had
my assurance that I would come. Usually
the very soul of courtesy and consideration,
that act alone would have
convinced me that there was an urgent
need for my presence at The Monstrosity.
That was Mercer&#8217;s own name for
the impressive pile that was at once his
residence and his laboratory.</p>
<p>I threw off the smoking-jacket and
pulled on a woolen golfing sweater, for
the wind was brisk and sharpish. In
two minutes I was backing the car out
of the garage; a moment later I was off
the gravelled drive and tearing down
the concrete with the accelerator all the
way down, and the black wind shrieking
around the windshield of my little
roadster.</p>
<p>My own shack was out of the city
limits&ndash;&ndash;a little place I keep to live in
when the urge to go fishing seizes me,
which is generally about twice a year.
Mercer picked the place up for me at
a song.</p>
<p>The Monstrosity was some four miles
further out from town, and off the
highway perhaps a half-mile more.</p>
<p>I made the four miles in just a shade
over that many minutes, and clamped
on the brakes as I saw the entrance to
the little drive that led toward the sea,
and Mercer&#8217;s estate.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">With</span> gravel rattling on my
fenders, I turned off the concrete
and swept between the two massive,
stuccoed pillars that guarded the
drive. Both of them bore corroded
bronze plates, &#8220;The Billows,&#8221; the name
given The Monstrosity by the original
owner, a newly-rich munitions manufacturer.</p>
<p>The structure itself loomed up before
me in a few seconds, a rambling
affair with square-shouldered balconies
and a great deal of wrought-iron work,
after the most flamboyant Spanish pattern.
It was ablaze with light. Apparently
every bulb in the place was burning.</p>
<p>Just a few yards beyond the surf
boomed hollowly on the smooth, shady
shore, littered now, I knew, by the pitiful
spoils of the storm.</p>
<p>As I clamped on my brakes, a swift
shadow passed two of the lower windows.
Before I could leap from the
car, the broad front door, with its
rounded top and circular, grilled window,
was flung wide, and Mercer came
running to meet me.</p>
<p>He was wearing a bathrobe, hastily
flung on over a damp bathing suit, his
bare legs terminating in a pair of disreputable
slippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, Taylor!&#8221; he greeted me. &#8220;I
suppose you&#8217;re wondering what it&#8217;s all
about. I don&#8217;t blame you. But come
in, come in! Just wait till you see her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her?&#8221; I asked, startled. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
in love, by any chance, and bringing me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
down here like this merely to back up
your own opinion of them eyes and
them lips, Mercer?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> laughed excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll see! No, I&#8217;m
not in love. And I want you to help,
and not admire. There are only Carson
and myself here, you know, and the
job&#8217;s too big for the two of us.&#8221; He
hurried me across the broad concrete
porch and into the house. &#8220;Throw the
cap anywhere and come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Too much amazed to comment further,
I followed my friend. This was a
Warren Mercer I did not know. Usually
his clean-cut, olive-tinted face was a
polite mask that seldom showed even
the slightest trace of emotion. His eyes,
dark and large, smiled easily, and shone
with interest, but his almost beautiful
mouth, beneath the long slim mustache,
always closely cropped, seldom smiled
with his eyes.</p>
<p>But it was his present excited speech
that amazed me most. Mercer, during
all the years I had known him, had
never been moved before to such tempestuous
outbursts of enthusiasm. It
was his habit to speak slowly and
thoughtfully, in his low, musical voice;
even in the midst of our hottest arguments,
and we had had many of them,
his voice had never lost its calm, unhurried
gentleness.</p>
<p>To my surprise, instead of leading
the way to the really comfortable, although
rather gaudy living room, Mercer
turned to the left, towards what
had been the billiard room, and was
now his laboratory.</p>
<p>The laboratory, brilliantly illuminated,
was littered, as usual, with apparatus
of every description. Along
one wall were the retorts, scales, racks,
hoods and elaborate set-ups, like the articulated
glass and rubber bones of
some weird prehistoric monster, that
demonstrated Mercer&#8217;s taste for this
branch of science. On the other side
of the room a corresponding workbench
was littered with a tangle of
coils, transformers, meters, tools and
instruments, and at the end of the
room, behind high black control panels,
with gleaming bus-bars and staring,
gaping meters, a pair of generators
hummed softly. The other end of the
room was nearly all glass, and opened
onto the patio and the swimming pool.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Mercer</span> paused a moment, with
his hand on the knob of the
door, a strange light in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ll see why I called you
here,&#8221; he said tensely. &#8220;You can judge
for yourself whether the trip was worth
while. Here she is!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a gesture he flung open the
door, and I stared, following his glance,
down at the great tiled swimming pool.</p>
<p>It is difficult for me to describe the
scene. The patio was not large, but it
was beautifully done. Flowers and
shrubs, even a few small palms, grew
in profusion in the enclosure, while
above, through the movable glass roof&ndash;&ndash;made
in sections to disappear in fine
weather&ndash;&ndash;was the empty blackness of
the sky.</p>
<p>None of the lights provided for the
illumination of the covered patio was
turned on, but all the windows surrounding
the patio were aglow, and I
could see the pool quite clearly.</p>
<p>The pool&ndash;&ndash;and its occupant.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">We</span> were standing at one side of
the pool, near the center. Directly
opposite us, seated on the bottom
of the pool, was a human figure,
nude save for a great mass of tawny
hair that fell about her like a silken
mantle. The strangely graceful figure
of a girl, one leg stretched out straight
before her, the other drawn up and
clasped by the interlocked fingers of
her hands. Even in the soft light I
could see her perfectly, through the
clear water, her pale body outlined
sharply against the jade green tiles.</p>
<p>I tore myself away from the staring,
curious eyes of the figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, Mercer, what is it?
Porcelain?&#8221; I asked hoarsely. The
thing had an indescribably eery effect.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span></div>
<p>He laughed wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Porcelain? Watch ... <i>look</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>My eyes followed his pointing finger.
The figure was moving. Gracefully it
arose to its full height. The great
cloud of corn-colored hair floated down
about it, falling below the knees. Slowly,
with a grace of movement comparable
only with the slow soaring of a
gull, she came toward me, walking on
the bottom of the pool through the
clear water as though she floated in air.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Fascinated,</span> I watched her. Her
eyes, startlingly large and dark in
the strangely white face, were fixed on
mine. There was nothing sinister in
the gaze, yet I felt my body shaking
as though in the grip of a terrible fear.
I tried to look away, and found myself
unable to move. I felt Mercer&#8217;s tense,
sudden grip upon my arm, but I did
not, could not, look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s smiling!&#8221; I heard him
exclaim. He laughed, an excited, high-pitched
laugh that irritated me in some
subtle way.</p>
<p>She was smiling, and looking up into
my eyes. She was very close now,
within a few feet of us. She came still
closer, until she was at my very feet as
I stood on the raised ledge that ran
around the edge of the pool, her head
thrown back, staring straight up at me
through the water.</p>
<p>I could see her teeth, very white between
her coral-pink lips, and her
bosom rising and falling beneath the
veil of pale gold hair. She was breathing
<i>water</i>!</p>
<p>Mercer literally jerked me away from
the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of her, Taylor?&#8221;
he asked, his dark eyes dancing with
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; I said, shaking
my head dazedly. &#8220;She is not human?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I think so. As human
as you or I. I&#8217;ll tell you all I
know, and then you can judge for yourself.
I think we&#8217;ll know in a few minutes,
if my plans work out. But first
slip on a bathing suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t argue the matter. I let Mercer
lead me away without a word. And
while I was changing, he told me all
he knew of the strange creature in the
pool.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">L</span><span class="dcap">ate</span> this afternoon I decided to
go for a little walk along the
beach,&#8221; Mercer began. &#8220;I had been
working like the devil since early in
the morning, running some tests on
what you call my thought-telegraph. I
felt the need of some fresh sea air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I walked along briskly for perhaps
five minutes, keeping just out of reach
of the rollers and the spray. The shore
was littered with all sorts of flotsam
and jetsam washed up by the big storm,
and I was just thinking that I would
have to have a man with a truck come
and clean up the shore in front of the
place, when, in a little sandy pool, I
saw&ndash;&ndash;<i>her</i>.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">S</span><span class="dcap">he</span> was laying face down in the
water, motionless, her head towards
the sea, one arm stretched out
before her, and her long hair wrapped
around her like a half-transparent
cloak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran up and lifted her from the
water. Her body was cold, and deathly
white, although her lips were faintly
pink, and her heart was beating, faintly
but steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like most people in an emergency.
I forgot all I ever knew about first aid.
All I could think of was to give her a
drink, and of course I didn&#8217;t have a
flask on my person. So I picked her up
in my arms and brought her to the
house as quickly as I could. She seemed
to be reviving, for she was struggling
and gasping when I got here with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I placed her on the bed in the guest
room and poured her a stiff drink of
Scotch&ndash;&ndash;half a tumblerful, I believe.
Lifting up her head, I placed the glass
to her lips. She looked up me, blinking,
and took the liquor in a single
draught. She did not seem to drink it,
but sucked it out of the glass in a
single amazing gulp&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s the only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
word for it. The next instant she was
off the bed, her face a perfect mask of
hate and agony.</p>
<p>&#8220;She came at me, hands clutching and
clawing, making odd murmuring or
mewing sounds in her throat. It was
then that I noticed for the first time
that her hands were webbed!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">ebbed?&#8221;</span> I asked, startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Webbed,&#8221; nodded Mercer
solemnly. &#8220;As are her feet. But listen,
Taylor. I was amazed, and not a little
rattled when she came for me. I ran
through the French windows out into
the patio. For a moment she ran after
me, rather awkwardly and heavily, but
swiftly, nevertheless. Then she saw
the pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently forgetting that I existed,
she leaped into the water, and as
I approached a moment later I could
see her breathing deeply and gratefully,
a smile of relief upon her features,
as she lay upon the bottom of the pool.
Breathing, Taylor, on the bottom of the
pool! Under eight feet of water!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then what, Mercer?&#8221; I reminded
him, as he paused, apparently
lost in thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to find out more about her.
I put on my bathing suit and dived into
the pool. Well, she came at me like a
shark, quick as a flash, her teeth showing,
her hands tearing like claws
through the water. I turned, but not
quickly enough to entirely escape.
See?&#8221; Mercer threw back the dressing
robe, and I saw a ragged tear in his
bathing suit on his left side, near the
waist. Through the rent three deep,
jagged scratches were clearly visible.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">S</span><span class="dcap">he</span> managed to claw me, just
once,&#8221; Mercer resumed, wrapping
the robe about him again. &#8220;Then
I got out and called on Carson for help.
I put him into a bathing suit, and we
both endeavored to corner her. Carson
got two bad scratches, and one rather
serious bite that I have bandaged. I
have a number of lacerations, but I
didn&#8217;t fare so badly as Carson because
I am faster in the water than he is.</p>
<p>&#8220;The harder we tried, the more determined
I became. She would sit
there, calm and placid, until one of us
entered the water. Then she became a
veritable fury. It was maddening.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last I thought of you. I phoned,
and here we are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mercer, it&#8217;s a nightmare!&#8221; I
protested. We moved out of the room.
&#8220;Nothing human can live under water
and breathe water, as she does!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercer paused a moment, staring at
me oddly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The human race,&#8221; he said gravely,
&#8220;came up out of sea. The human race
as we know it. Some may have gone
back.&#8221; He turned and walked away
again, and I hurried after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean. Mercer? &#8216;Some
may have gone back?&#8217; I don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercer shook his head, but made no
other reply until we stood again on the
edge of the pool.</p>
<p>The girl was standing where we had
left her, and as she looked up into my
face, she smiled again, and made a
quick gesture with one hand. It
seemed to me that she invited me to
join her.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">I</span><span class="dcap"> believe</span> she likes you, Taylor,&#8221;
said Mercer thoughtfully.
&#8220;You&#8217;re light, light skin, light hair.
Carson and I are both very dark, almost
swarthy. And in that white bathing
suit&ndash;&ndash;yes, I believe she&#8217;s taken a fancy
to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercer&#8217;s eyes were dancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she has,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;it&#8217;ll make
our work very easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What work?&#8221; I asked suspiciously.
Mercer, always an indefatigable experimenter,
was never above using his
friends in the benefit of science. And
some of his experiments in the past
had been rather trying, not to say exciting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have what you call my
thought-telegraph perfected, experimentally,&#8221;
he explained rapidly. &#8220;I fell
asleep working on it at three o&#8217;clock,
or thereabouts, this morning, and some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
tests with Carson seem to indicate that
it is a success. I should have called
you to-morrow, for further test. Nearly
five years of damned hard work to
a successful conclusion, Taylor, and
then this mermaid comes along and
makes my experiment appear about as
important as one of those breakers rolling
in out there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you plan to do now?&#8221;
I asked eagerly, glancing down at the
beautiful pale face that glimmered up
at me through the clear water of the
pool.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hy,</span> try it on her!&#8221; exclaimed
Mercer with mounting enthusiasm.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, Taylor? If it
will work on her, and we can direct her
thoughts, we can find out her history,
the history of her people! We&#8217;ll add a
page to scientific history&ndash;&ndash;a whole big
chapter!&ndash;&ndash;that will make us famous.
Man this is so big it&#8217;s swept me off my
feet! Look!&#8221; And he held out a thin,
aristocratic brown hand before my
eyes, a hand that shook with nervous
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; I said quickly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m no savant, and still I see what an
amazing thing this is. Let&#8217;s get busy.
What can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercer reached around the door into
the laboratory and pressed a button.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Carson,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
need his help. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll
look over the set-up. The apparatus is
strewn all over the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not exaggerated. The set-up
consisted of a whole bank of tubes,
each one in its own shielding copper
box. On a much-drilled horizontal
panel, propped up on insulators, were
half a score of delicate meters of one
kind and another, with thin black fingers
that pulsed and trembled. Behind
the panel was a tall cylinder wound
with shining copper wire, and beside it
another panel, upright, fairly bristling
with knobs, contact points, potentiometers,
rheostats and switches. On the
end of the table nearest the door was
still another panel, the smallest of the
lot, bearing only a series of jacks along
one side, and in the center a switch
with four contact points. A heavy,
snaky cable led from this panel to the
maze of apparatus further on.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">T</span><span class="dcap">his</span> is the control panel,&#8221; explained
Mercer. &#8220;The whole affair,
you understand, is in laboratory
form. Nothing assembled. Put the different
antennae plug into these jacks.
Like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked up a weird, hastily built
contrivance composed of two semi-circular
pieces of spring brass, crossed at
right angles. On all four ends were
bright silvery electrodes, three of them
circular in shape, one of them elongated
and slightly curved. With a quick, nervous
gesture, Mercer fitted the thing to
his head, so that the elongated electrode
pressed against the back of his
neck, extending a few inches down his
spine. The other three circular electrodes
rested on his forehead and either
side of his head. From the center of
the contrivance ran a heavy insulated
cord, some ten feet in length, ending
in a simple switchboard plug, which
Mercer fitted into the uppermost of the
three jacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;you put on this
one&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he adjusted a second contrivance
upon my head, smiling as I shrank from
the contact of the cold metal on my
skin&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and think!&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved the switch from the position
marked &#8220;Off&#8221; to the second contact
point, watching me intently, his
dark eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>Carson entered, and Mercer gestured
to him to wait. Very nice old chap,
Carson, impressive even in his bathing
suit. Mercer was mighty lucky to have
a man like Carson....</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Something</span> seemed to tick suddenly,
somewhere deep in my consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s very true: Carson is a
most decent sort of chap.&#8221; The words
were not spoken. I did not <i>hear</i> them,
I <i>knew</i> them. What&ndash;&ndash;I glanced at Mercer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
and he laughed aloud with pleasure
and excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It worked!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I received
your thought regarding Carson, and
then turned the switch so that you received
my thought. And you did!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather gingerly I removed the thing
from my head and laid it on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wizardry, Mercer! If it will
work as well on <i>her</i>....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will, I know it will!&ndash;&ndash;if we can
get her to wear one of these,&#8221; replied
Mercer confidently. &#8220;I have only three
of them; I had planned some three-cornered
experiments with you, Carson,
and myself. We&#8217;ll leave Carson out of
to-night&#8217;s experiment, however, for
we&#8217;ll need him to operate this switch.
You see, as it is now wired only one
person transmits thoughts at a time.
The other two receive. When the
switch is on the first contact, Number
One sends, and Numbers Two and
Three receive. When the switch is on
Number Two, then he sends thoughts,
and Numbers One and Three receive
them. And so on. I&#8217;ll lengthen these
leads so that we can run them out into
the pool, and then we&#8217;ll be ready. Somehow
we must induce her to wear one of
these things, even if we have to use
force. I&#8217;m sure the three of us can
handle her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be able to,&#8221; I smiled. She
was such a slim, graceful, almost delicate
little thing; the thought that three
strong men might not be able to control
her seemed almost amusing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen her in action yet,&#8221;
said Mercer grimly, glancing up from
his work of lengthening the cords that
led from the antennae to the control
panel. &#8220;And what&#8217;s more, I hope you
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I watched</span> him in silence as he
spliced and securely taped the last
connection.</p>
<p>&#8220;All set,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;Carson, will
you operate the switch for us? I believe
everything is functioning properly.&#8221;
He surveyed the panel of instruments
hastily, assuring himself that
every reading was correct. Then, with
all three of the devices he called antennae
in his hand, their leads plugged
into the control panel, he led the way
to the side of the pool.</p>
<p>The girl was strolling around the
edge of the pool, feeling the smooth
tile sides with her hands as we came
into view, but as soon as she saw us she
shot through the water to where we
were standing.</p>
<p>It was the first time I had seen her
move in this fashion. She seemed to
propel herself with a sudden mighty
thrust of her feet against the bottom;
she darted through the water with the
speed of an arrow, yet stopped as gently
as though she had merely floated
there.</p>
<p>As she looked up, her eyes unmistakably
sought mine, and her smile
seemed warm and inviting. She made
again that strange little gesture of invitation.</p>
<p>With an effort I glanced at Mercer.
There was something devilishly fascinating
about the girl&#8217;s great, dark,
searching eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in,&#8221; I said hoarsely.
&#8220;Hand me one of your head-set things
when I reach for it.&#8221; Before he could
protest, I dived into the pool.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I headed</span> directly towards the
heavy bronze ladder that led to the
bottom of the pool. I had two reasons
in mind. I would need something to
keep me under water, with my lungs
full of air, and I could get out quickly
if it were necessary. I had not forgotten
the livid, jagged furrows in Mercer&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>Quickly as I shot to the ladder she
was there before me, a dim, wavering
white shape, waiting.</p>
<p>I paused, holding to a rung of the
ladder with one hand. She came closer,
walking with the airy grace I had noted
before, and my heart pounded against
my ribs as she raised one long, slim
arm towards me.</p>
<p>The hand dropped gently on my
shoulder, pressed it as though in token
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
of friendship. Perhaps, I thought
quickly, this was, with her, a sign of
greeting. I lifted my own arm and returned
the salutation, if salutation it
were, aware of a strange rising and
falling sound, as of a distant humming,
in my ears.</p>
<p>The sound ceased suddenly, on a rising
note, as though of inquiry, and it
dawned on me that I had heard the
speech of this strange creature. Before
I could think of a course of action, my
aching lungs reminded me of the need
of air, and I released my hold on the
ladder and let my body rise to the surface.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">As</span> my head broke the water, a
hand, cold and strong as steel,
closed around my ankle. I looked
down. The girl was watching me, and
there was no smile on her face now.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; I shouted across the pool
to Mercer, who was watching anxiously.
Then, filling my lungs with air
again, I pulled myself, by means of the
ladder, to the bottom of the pool. The
restraining hand was removed instantly.</p>
<p>The strange creature thrust her face
close to mine as my feet touched bottom,
and for the first time I saw her
features distinctly.</p>
<p>She was beautiful, but in a weird,
unearthly sort of way. As I had already
noticed, her eyes were of unusual
size, and I saw now that they were an
intense shade of blue, with a pupil of
extraordinary proportion. Her nose
was well shaped, but the nostrils were
slightly flattened, and the orifices were
rather more elongated than I had ever
seen before. The mouth was utterly
fascinating, and her teeth, revealed by
her engaging smile, were as perfect as
it would be possible to imagine.</p>
<p>The great mane of hair which enveloped
her was, as I have said, tawny in
hue, and almost translucent, like the
stems of some seaweeds I have seen.
And as she raised one slim white hand
to brush back some wisps that floated
by her face, I saw distinctly the webs
between her fingers. They were barely
noticeable, for they were as transparent
as the fins of a fish, but they were there,
extending nearly to the last joint of
each finger.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">As</span> her face came close to my own,
I became aware of the humming,
crooning sound I had heard before,
louder this time. I could see, from the
movement of her throat, that I had been
correct in assuming that she was attempting
to speak with me. I smiled
back at her and shook my head. She
seemed to understand, for the sound
ceased, and she studied me with a little
thoughtful frown, as though trying to
figure out some other method of communication.</p>
<p>I pointed upward, for I was feeling
the need for fresh air again, and slowly
mounted the ladder. This time she did
not grasp me, but watched me intently,
as though understanding what I did,
and the reasons for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring one of your gadgets over
here, Mercer,&#8221; I called across the pool.
&#8220;I think I&#8217;m making progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good boy!&#8221; he cried, and came running
with two of the antennae, the
long insulated cords trailing behind
him. Through the water the girl
watched him, evident dislike in her
eyes. She glanced at me with sudden
suspicion as Mercer handed me the two
instruments, but made no hostile move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to stay in the
water with her,&#8221; explained Mercer
rapidly. &#8220;The salt water would short
the antennae, you see. Try to get her
to wear one, and then you get your
head out of water, and don yours. And
remember, she won&#8217;t be able to communicate
with us by words&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll have
to get her to convey her thoughts by
means of mental pictures. I&#8217;ll try to
impress that on her. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I nodded,</span> and picked up one of
the instruments. &#8220;Fire when ready,
Gridley,&#8221; I commented, and sank again
to the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>I touched the girl&#8217;s head with one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
finger, and then pointed to my own
head, trying to convey to her that she
could get her thoughts to me. Then I
held up the antennae and placed it on
my own head to show that it could not
harm her.</p>
<p>My next move was to offer her the
instrument, moving slowly, and smiling
reassuringly&ndash;&ndash;no mean feat under
water.</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, and then,
her eyes fixed on mine, she slowly
fixed the instrument over her own head
as she had seen me adjust it upon my
own.</p>
<p>I smiled and nodded, and pressed her
shoulder in token of friendly greeting.
Then, gesturing toward my own head
again, and pointing upward. I climbed
the ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mercer,&#8221; I shouted.
&#8220;Start at once, before she grows restless!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already started!&#8221; he called
back, and I hurriedly donned my own
instrument.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind what Mercer had
said, I descended the ladder but a few
rungs, so that my head remained out of
water, and smiled down at the girl,
touching the instrument on my head,
and then pointing to hers.</p>
<p>I could sense Mercer&#8217;s thoughts now.
He was picturing himself walking
long the shore, with the stormy ocean
in the background. Ahead of him I
saw the white body lying face downward
in the pool. I saw him run up to
the pool and lift the slim, pale figure
in his arms.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Let</span> me make it clear, at this point,
that when I say that I saw these
things, I mean only that mental images
of them penetrated my consciousness.
I visualized them just as I could close
my eyes and visualize, for example, the
fireplace in the living room of my own
home.</p>
<p>I looked down at the girl. She was
frowning, and her eyes were very wide.
Her head was a little on one side, in
the attitude of one who listens intently.</p>
<p>Slowly and carefully Mercer thought
out the whole story of his experiences
with the girl until she had plunged
into the pool. Then I saw again the
beach, with the girl&#8217;s figure in the pool.
The picture grew hazy; I realized Mercer
was trying to picture the bottom of
the sea. Then he pictured again the
girl lying in the pool, and once again
the sea. I was aware of the soft little
tick in the center of my brain that announced
that the switch had been
moved to another contact point.</p>
<p>I glanced down at her. She was staring
up at me with her great, curious
eyes, and I sensed, through the medium
of the instrument I wore, that she was
thinking of me. I saw my own features,
idealized, glowing with a strange
beauty that was certainly none of my
own. I realized that I saw myself, in
short, as she saw me. I smiled back at
her, and shook my head.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A strange,</span> dim whirl of pictures
swept through my consciousness.
I was on the bottom of the
ocean. Shadowy shapes swept by silently,
and from above, a dim bluish
light filtered down on a scene such as
mortal eyes have never seen.</p>
<p>All around were strange structures
of jagged coral, roughly circular as to
base, and rounded on top, resembling
very much the igloos of the Eskimos.
The structures varied greatly in size,
and seemed to be arranged in some sort
of regular order, like houses along a
narrow street. Around many of them
grew clusters of strange and colorful
seaweeds that waved their banners
gently, as though some imperceptible
current dallied with them in passing.</p>
<p>Here and there figures moved, slim
white figures that strolled along the
narrow street, or at times shot overhead
like veritable torpedoes.</p>
<p>There were both men and women
moving there. The men were broader
of shoulder, and their hair, which they
wore to their knees, was somewhat
darker in color than that of the women.
Both sexes were slim, and there was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
remarkable uniformity of size and appearance.</p>
<p>None of the strange beings wore garments
of any kind, nor were they necessary.
The clinging tresses were cinctured
at the waist with a sort of cord
of twisted orange-colored material, and
some of the younger women wore bands
of the same material around their
brows.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Nearest</span> of all the figures was
the girl who was visualizing all
this for us. She was walking slowly
away from the cluster of coral structures.
Once or twice she paused, and
seemed to hold conversation with
others of the strange people, but each
time she moved on.</p>
<p>The coral structures grew smaller
and poorer. Finally the girl trod alone
on the floor of the ocean, between great
growths of kelp and seaweeds, with
dim, looming masses of faintly tinted
coral everywhere. Once she passed
close to a tilted, ragged hulk of some
ancient vessel, its naked ribs packed
with drifted sand.</p>
<p>Sauntering dreamily, she moved
away from the ancient derelict. Suddenly
a dim shadow swept across the
sand at her feet, and she arrowed from
the spot like a white, slim meteor. But
behind her darted a black and swifter
shadow&ndash;&ndash;a shark!</p>
<p>Like a flash she turned and faced the
monster. Something she had drawn
from her girdle shone palely in her
hand. It was a knife of whetted stone
or bone.</p>
<p>Darting swiftly downward her feet
spurned the yellow sand, and she shot
at her enemy with amazing speed. The
long blade swept in an arc, ripped the
pale belly of the monster just as he
turned to dart away.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A great</span> cloud of blood dyed the
water. The white figure of the
girl shot onward through the scarlet
flood.</p>
<p>Blinded, she did not see that the jutting
ribs of the ancient ship were in
her path. I seemed to see her crash,
head on, into one of the massive timbers,
and I cried out involuntarily, and
glanced down at the girl in the water
at my feet.</p>
<p>Her eyes were glowing. She knew
that I had understood.</p>
<p>Hazily, then, I seemed to visualize
her body floating limply in the water.
It was all very vague and indistinct,
and I understood that this was not
what she had seen, but what she
thought had happened. The impressions
grew wilder, swirled, grew gray
and indistinct. Then I had a view of
Mercer&#8217;s face, so terribly distorted it
was barely recognizable. Then a kaleidoscopic
maze of inchoate scenes,
shot through with flashes of vivid,
agonizing colors. The girl was thinking
of her suffering, taken out of her
native element. In trying to save her,
Mercer had almost killed her. That,
no doubt, was why she hated him.</p>
<p>My own face appeared next, almost
godlike in its kindliness and its imagined
beauty, and I noticed now that
she was thinking of me with my yellow
hair grown long, my nostrils elongated
like her own&ndash;&ndash;adjusted to her own
ideas of what a man should be.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I flung</span> the instrument from my
head and dropped to the bottom of
the pool. I gripped both her shoulders,
gently, to express my thanks and friendship.</p>
<p>My heart was pounding. There was
a strange fascination about this girl
from the depths of the sea, a subtle appeal
that was answered from some deep
subterranean cavern of my being. I
forgot, for the moment, who and what
I was. I remembered only that a note
had been sounded that awoke an echo
of a long-forgotten instinct.</p>
<p>I think I kissed her. I know her
arms were about me, and that I pressed
her close, so that our faces almost met.
Her great, weirdly blue eyes seemed to
bore into my brain. I could feel them
throbbing there....</p>
<p>I forgot time and space. I saw only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
that pale, smiling face and those great
dark eyes. Then, strangling, I tore myself
from her embrace and shot to the
surface.</p>
<p>Coughing, I cleared my lungs of the
water I had inhaled. I was weak and
shaking when I finished, but my head
was clear. The grip of the strange fantasy
that had gripped me was shaken
off.</p>
<p>Mercer was bending over me; speaking
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was watching, old man,&#8221; he said
gently. &#8220;I can imagine what happened.
A momentary, psychic fusing of an ancient,
long since broken link. You, together
with all mankind, came up out
of the sea. But there is no retracing
the way.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I nodded,</span> my head bowed on my
streaming chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Mercer,&#8221; I muttered. &#8220;Something
got into me. Those big eyes of
hers seemed to tug at threads of memory
... buried.... I can&#8217;t describe
it....&#8221;</p>
<p>He slapped me on my naked shoulder,
a blow that stung, as he had intended
it to. It helped jerk me back to
the normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your feet on the ground
again, Taylor,&#8221; he commented soothingly.
&#8220;I think there&#8217;s no danger of
you losing your grip on terra firma
again. Shall we carry on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more you&#8217;d like to learn?
That you think she can give us?&#8221; I
asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; replied Mercer, &#8220;that she
can give us the history of her people,
if we can only make her understand
what we wish. God! If we only could!&#8221;
The name of the Deity was a prayer as
Mercer uttered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can try, old-timer,&#8221; I said, a bit
shakenly.</p>
<p>Mercer hurried back to the other
side of the pool, and I adjusted my
head-set again, smiling down at the
girl. If only Mercer could make her
understand, and if only she knew what
we wanted to learn!</p>
<p>I was conscious of the little click that
told me the switch had been moved.
Mercer was ready to get his message
to her.</p>
<p>Fixing my eyes on the girl pleadingly,
I settled myself by the edge of the
pool to await the second and more momentous
part of our experiment.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> vision was vague, for Mercer
was picturing his thoughts with
difficulty. But I seemed to see again
the floor of the ocean, with the vague
light filtering down from above, and
soft, monstrous growths waving their
branches lazily in the flood.</p>
<p>From the left came a band of men
and women, looking around as though
in search of some particular spot. They
stopped, and one of the older men
pointed, the others gathering around
him as though in council.</p>
<p>Then the band set to work. Coral
growth were dragged to the spot. The
foundation for one of the semi-circular
houses was laid. The scene swirled
and cleared again. The house was completed.
Several other houses were in
process of building.</p>
<p>Slowly and deliberately, the scene
moved. The houses were left behind.
Before my consciousness now was only
a vague and shadowy expanse of ocean
floor, and in the sand dim imprints that
marked where the strange people had
trod, the vague footprints disappearing
in the gloom in the direction from
which the little weary band had come.
To me, at least, it was quite clear that
Mercer was asking whence they came.
Would it be as clear to the girl? The
switch clicked, and for a moment I was
sure Mercer had not been able to make
his question clear to her.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> scene was the interior of one
of the coral houses. There were
persons there, seated on stone or coral
chairs, padded with marine growths.
One of the occupants of the room was
a very old man; his face was wrinkled,
and his hair was silvery. With him
were a man and a woman, and a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
girl. Somehow I seemed to recognize
the child as the girl in the pool.</p>
<p>The three of them were watching the
old man. While his lips did not move,
I could see his throat muscles twitching
as the girl&#8217;s had done when she
made the murmuring sound I had
guessed was her form of speech.</p>
<p>The scene faded. For perhaps
thirty seconds I was aware of nothing
more than a dim gray mist that seemed
to swirl in stately circles. Then, gradually,
it cleared somewhat. I sensed the
fact that what I saw now was what the
old man was telling, and that the majestic,
swirling mist was the turning
back of time.</p>
<p>Here was no ocean bottom, but land,
rich tropical jungle. Strange exotic
trees and dense growths of rank undergrowth
choked the earth. The trees
were oddly like undersea growths,
which puzzled me for an instant. Then
I recalled that the girl could interpret
the old man&#8217;s words only in terms of
that which she had seen and understood.
This was the way she visualized
the scene.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">There</span> was a gray haze of mist
everywhere. The leaves were glistening
with condensed moisture; swift
drops fell incessantly to the soaking
ground below.</p>
<p>Into the scene roamed a pitiful band
of people. Men with massive frames,
sunken in with starvation, women tottering
with weakness. The men carried
great clubs, some tipped with
rudely shaped stone heads, and both
men and women clothed only in
short kittles of skin.</p>
<p>They searched ceaselessly for something,
and I guessed that something
was food. Now and then one or the
other of the little band tore up a root
and bit at it, and those that did so soon
doubled into a twitching knot of suffering
and dropped behind.</p>
<p>At last they came to the edge of the
sea. A few yards away the water was
lost in the dense steaming miasma that
hemmed them in on all sides. With
glad expressions on their faces, the
party ran down to the edge of the
water and gathered up great masses of
clams and crabs. At first they ate the
food raw, tearing the flesh from the
shells. Then they made what I understood
was a fire, although the girl was
able to visualize it only as a bright red
spot that flickered.</p>
<p>The scene faded, and there was only
the slowly swirling mist that I understood
indicated the passing of centuries.
Then the scene cleared again.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I saw</span> that same shore line, but the
people had vanished. There was
only the thick, steamy mist, the tropic
jungle crowding down to the shore,
and the waves rolling in monotonously
from the waste of gray ocean beyond
the curtain of fog.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from out of the sea, appeared
a series of human heads, and
then a band of men and women that
waded ashore and seated themselves
upon the beach, gazing restlessly out
across the sea.</p>
<p>This was not the same band I had
seen at first. These were a slimmer
race, and whereas the first band had
been exceedingly swarthy, these were
very fair.</p>
<p>They did not stay long on shore, for
they were restless and ill at ease. It
seemed to me they came there only
from force of habit, as though they
obeyed some inner urge they did not
understand. In a few seconds they rose
and ran into the water, plunged into it
as though they welcomed its embrace,
and disappeared. Then again the
vision was swallowed up by the swirling
mists of time.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">When</span> the scene cleared again,
it showed the bottom of the sea.
A group of perhaps a hundred pale
creatures moved along the dim floor of
the ocean. Ahead I could see the dim
outlines of one of their strange cities.
The band approached, seemed to talk
with those there, and moved on.</p>
<p>I saw them capture and kill fish for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
food, saw them carve the thick, spongy
hearts from certain giant growths and
eat them. I saw a pair of killer sharks
swoop down on the band, and the
quick, deadly accuracy with which
both men and woman met the attack.
One man, older than the rest, was injured
before the sharks were vanquished,
and when their efforts to
staunch his wounds proved unavailing,
they left him there and moved on. And
as they left I saw a dim, crawling shape
move closer, throw out a long, whiplike
tentacle, and wrap the body in a
hungry embrace.</p>
<p>They came to and passed other communities
of beings like themselves, and
a city of their own, in much the way
that Mercer had visualized it.</p>
<p>Fading, the scene changed to the interior
of the coral house again. The
old man finished his story, and moved
off into a cubicle in the rear of the
place. Dimly, I could see there a low
couch, piled high with soft marine
growths. Then the scene shifted once
more.</p>
<p>A man and a woman hurried up and
down the narrow streets of the strange
city the girl had pictured when she
showed us how she had met with the
shark, and struck her head, so that for
a long period she lost consciousness
and was washed ashore.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Others</span>, after a time, joined them
in their search, which spread out
to the floor of the ocean, away from
the dwellings. One party came to the
gaunt skeleton of the ancient wreck,
and found the scattered, fresh-picked
bones of the shark the girl had killed.
The man and the woman came up, and
I looked closely into their faces. The
woman&#8217;s features were torn with grief;
the man&#8217;s lips were set tight with suffering.
Here, it was easy to guess, were
the mother and the father of the girl.</p>
<p>A milling mass of white forms shot
through the water in every direction,
searching. It seemed that they were
about to give up the search when suddenly,
from out of the watery gloom,
there shot a slim white figure&ndash;&ndash;the girl!</p>
<p>Straight to the mother and father
she came, gripping the shoulder of
each with frantic joy. They returned
the caress, the crowd gathered around
them, listening to her story as they
moved slowly, happily, towards the
distant city.</p>
<p>Instead of a picture, I was conscious
then of a sound, like a single pleading
word repeated softly, as though someone
said &#8220;Please! Please! Please!&#8221; over
and over again. The sound was not at
all like the English word. It was a
soft, musical beat, like the distant
stroke of a mellow gong, but it had all
the pleading quality of the word it
seemed to bring to mind.</p>
<p>I looked down into the pool. The
girl had mounted the ladder until her
face was just below the surface of the
water. Her eyes met mine and I knew
that I had not misunderstood.</p>
<p>I threw off the instrument on my
head, and dropped down beside her.
With both hands I grasped her shoulders,
and, smiling, I nodded my head
vigorously.</p>
<p>She understood, I know she did. I
read it in her face. When I climbed
the ladder again, she looked after me,
smiling confidently.</p>
<p>Although I had not spoken to her,
she had read and accepted the promise.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Mercer</span> stared at me silently,
grimly, as I told him what I
wished. Whatever eloquence I may
have, I used on him, and I saw his cold,
scientific mind waver before the
warmth of my appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no right to keep her from
her people,&#8221; I concluded. &#8220;You saw her
mother and father, saw their suffering,
and the joy her return would bring.
You will, Mercer&ndash;&ndash;you will return her
to the sea?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time, Mercer did not reply.
Then he lifted his dark eyes to
mine, and smiled, rather wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the only thing we can do,
Taylor,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;She is not
a scientific specimen; she is, in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
way, as human as you or I. She would
probably die, away from her own kind,
living under conditions foreign to her.
And you promised her, Taylor,
whether you spoke your promise or
not.&#8221; His smile deepened a bit. &#8220;We
cannot let her receive too bad an
opinion of her cousins who live above
the surface of the sea!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">And</span> so, just as the dawn was
breaking, we took her to the
shore. I carried her, unresisting,
trustful, in my arms, while Mercer
bore a huge basin of water, in which
her head was submerged, so that she
might not suffer.</p>
<p>Still in our bathing suits we waded
out into the ocean, until the waves
splashed against our faces. Then I
lowered her into the sea. Crouching
there, so that the water was just above
the tawny glory of her hair, she gazed
up at us. Two slim white hands
reached towards us, and with one accord,
Mercer and I bent towards her.
She gripped both our shoulders with a
gentle pressure, smiling at us.</p>
<p>Then she did a strange thing. She
pointed, under the water, out towards
the depths and with a broad, sweeping
motion of her arm, indicated the
shore, as though to say that she intended
to return. With a last swift,
smiling glance up into my face, she
turned. There was a flash of white
through the water. She was gone....</p>
<p>Silently, through the silence and
beauty of the dawn, we made our way
back to the house.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">As</span> we passed through the laboratory,
Mercer glanced out at the
empty pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man came up from the sea,&#8221; he said
slowly, &#8220;and some men went back to it.
They were forced back to the teeming
source from whence they came, for
lack of food. You saw that, Taylor&ndash;&ndash;saw
her forebears become amphibians,
like the now extinct Dipneusta and
Ganoideii, or the still existing Neoceratodus,
Polypterus and Amia. Then
their lungs became, in effect, gills, and
they lost their power of breathing atmospheric
air, and could use only air
dissolved in water.</p>
<p>&#8220;A whole people there beneath the
waves that land-man never dreamed of&ndash;&ndash;except,
perhaps, the sailors of olden
days, with their tales of mermaids,
which we are accustomed to laugh at in
our wisdom!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why were no bodies ever
washed ashore?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I would
think&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw why,&#8221; interrupted Mercer
grimly. &#8220;The ocean teems with hungry
life. Death is the signal for a
feast. It was little more than a
miracle that her body came ashore, a
miracle due perhaps to the storm which
sent the hungry monsters to the
greater depths. And even had a body
come ashore it would have been buried
as that of some unknown, unfortunate
human. The differences between these
people and ourselves would not be
noticeable to a casual observer.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Taylor, we have been party to
what was close to a miracle. And we
are the only witnesses to it, you and
Carson and myself. And&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he sighed
deeply&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not reply. I was thinking of
the girl&#8217;s odd gesture, at parting, and
I wondered if it were indeed a finished
chapter.</p>

<i>Many planes and Zeppelins were circling around the mysterious visitant.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It</span> came suddenly, without warning,
and it brought consternation to
the people of the world.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>A livid flame flares across Space&ndash;&ndash;and
over Manhattan hovers Teuxical, vassal
of Malfero, Lord of the Universe, who
comes with ten thousand warriors
to ravage and subjugate one more planet
for his master.</p>
<p>A filament of flame darted down
the dark skies
one moonless
night and those
who saw it believed,
at first,
that it was a meteor.
Instead of
streaking away into oblivion, however,
it became larger and larger, until it
seemed as though some vagrant, blazing
star was about to plunge into the
earth and annihilate
the planet
and every vestige
of life upon it.
But then it drew
slowly to a stop
high up in the atmosphere,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
where it remained motionless,
glowing white and incandescent
against the Stygian background of the
overcast skies.</p>
<p>In shape it resembled a Zeppelin,
but its dimensions very apparently exceeded
by far those of any flying craft
that ever had been fabricated by the
hand of man.</p>
<p>As it hung poised high up in the air
it gradually lost its dazzling glow and
became scarlet instead of white. Then,
as it continued to cool, the color
swiftly drained from it and, in a few
minutes, it shone only with the dull
and ugly crimson of an expiring ember.
In a half-hour after it first had appeared
its effulgence had vanished
completely and it was barely visible to
the millions who were staring up toward
it from the earth.</p>

</div>
<p>It seemed to be suspended directly
above Manhattan, and the inhabitants
of New York were thrown into a feverish
excitement by the strange and unprecedented
phenomenon.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">For</span> it scarcely had come to a stop,
and certainly it had not been
poised aloft for more than a few minutes,
when most of those who had not
actually witnessed its sensational appearance
were apprised of the inexplicable
occurrence by the radiovision,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
which were scattered throughout the
vast metropolis. In theaters and restaurants
and other gathering places, as
well as in millions of homes, a voice
from the Worldwide Broadcasting
Tower announced the weird visitant.
And its image, as it glowed in the
night, was everywhere transmitted to
the public.</p>
<p>Only a short time after it first had
been observed people were thronging
roof-tops, terraces, and streets, and
gazing with awe and wonder at the
great luminous object that was floating
high above them.</p>
<p>There were those who thought that
the world was coming to an end, and
they either were dumb with fright or
strident with hysteria. People with
more judgment, and a smattering of
scientific knowledge, dismissed the
thing as some harmless meteorological
manifestation that, while interesting,
was not necessarily dangerous. And
there were many, inclined to incredulity
and skepticism, who believed
that they were witnessing a hoax or an
advertising scheme of some new sort.</p>
<p>But as the moments went by the
world commenced to become stirred
and alarmed by the reports which came
over the radiovisors.</p>
<p>For powerful planes and metal-shelled
Zeppelins had climbed swiftly
aloft to investigate the incomprehensible
Thing that was poised high
above Manhattan, and almost unbelievable
reports were being sent earthward.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk Vanderpool</span> had been
sitting alone on the broad terrace
of his apartment that occupied the
upper stories of the great Gotham
Gardens Building when he saw that
streak of fire slip down against the
darkness of the night.</p>
<p>For a moment he, too, had believed
that he was watching a meteor, but,
when he saw it come to a slow stop
and hang stationary in the heavens, he
rose to his feet with an exclamation of
surprise.</p>
<p>For a while he gazed upward with an
expression of astonishment on his face
and then he turned as he heard someone
walking softly in his direction. It
was Barstowe, his valet, and the eyes
of the man were alive with fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that thing, Mr. Vanderpool?&#8221;
he asked in a voice that trembled
with alarm. Barstowe was a man
of middle age, diminutive in size, and
he had the appearance of being nearly
petrified with terror. &#8220;They are saying
over the televisor that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they saying about it?&#8221;
asked Dirk somewhat impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;That no one can explain what it is,&#8221;
continued Barstowe. &#8220;It must be something
terrible, Mr. Vanderpool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wheel out the luciscope,&#8221; ordered
Dirk.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Barstowe</span> disappeared into the
apartment and returned with a
cabinet that was mounted on small,
rubber-tired wheels. The top of it was
formed of a metallic frame in which a
heavy, circular, concave glass was
fitted. The frame was hinged in front
so that it could be raised from the rear
and adjusted to any angle necessary to
catch the light rays from any distant
object. Within the cabinet the rays
passed through an electrical device
that amplified them millions of times,
thus giving a clear, telescopic vision of
the object on which the luciscope was
focused.</p>
<p>This instrument, years before, had
supplanted entirely the old-fashioned
telescopes which not only had been immense
and unwieldly but which also
had a very limited range of vision.</p>
<p>Dirk adjusted the light-converger so
that it caught the rays that were being
emanated by the weird and shimmering
mass that was suspended almost directly
above the lofty terrace on which
he was standing.</p>
<p>Then he switched on the current and
glanced into the eye-piece of the apparatus.
For several moments he remained
silent, studying the image that
was etched so vividly on the ground-glass
within the luciscope.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is a queer thing, there is no doubt
about that,&#8221; he confessed when finally
he raised his head. &#8220;It resembles a
gigantic Zeppelin in shape but it does
not seem to have any undercarriage or,
as far as I can see, any indication of
propellers or portholes. I would say,
though, Barstowe, that it might be a
ship from some other planet if it wasn&#8217;t
for the fact that it seems to be in an
almost molten state.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> again looked into the luciscope
and then he made a few adjustments
with a thumb-screw that
projected from the side of the apparatus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is up about forty thousand feet,&#8221;
he told Barstowe, &#8220;and it must be more
than a half-mile in length. Probably,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;it is a planetary fragment
of some odd composition that is less
responsive to gravitation than the materials
with which we are familiar. You
will find, Barstowe, that there is nothing
about it that science will not be
able to explain. That will be all now,&#8221;
he concluded.</p>
<p>Barstowe walked over the terrace and
disappeared into the apartment. Dirk,
left alone, wheeled the luciscope over
by the chair in which he had been sitting
and near which a radiovisor was
standing.</p>
<p>He switched on the latter and listened
to the low but very distinct voice
of the news-dispatcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;and planes and Zeppelins now are
starting up to investigate the strange
phenomenon&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Dirk placed an eye to the lens
of the luciscope and once more the
Thing leaped into his vision. The
powerful machine brought it so close
to him that he could see the heat waves
quiver up from it.</p>
<p>The light that it radiated illuminated
the night for thousands of feet and
Dirk could see, by means of that crimson
glare, that many planes and Zeppelins
were circling around the mysterious
visitant. None of them, however,
approached the alien freak, the heat apparently
being too intense to permit
close inspection.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> himself was tempted for a
moment to jump into a plane and
go up and take a look at the fiery mass.</p>
<p>But, after a moment&#8217;s consideration,
he decided, that it would be far more
interesting and comfortable to remain
right where he was and listen to the
reports which were being sent down
from above.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;thus far there seems to be no
cause for alarm, and people are advised
to remain calm&ndash;&ndash;careful observations of
the luminous monster are being made
and further reports concerning it will
be broadcast&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk Vanderpool rose to his feet,
walked to the coping of the terrace
and peered into the magnascope that
was set into the wall.</p>
<p>He saw that the street, far below
him, was jammed with struggling people
and the device through which he
was looking brought their faces before
him in strong relief. Dirk was deeply
interested and, at the same time,
gravely concerned as he studied the
upturned countenances in the mob.</p>
<p>Fear, despair, reckless abandon,
mirth, doubt, religious <a name='TC_28'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'ecstacy'">ecstasy</ins> and all
the other nuances in the gamut of human
emotions and passions were reflected
in those distorted visages which
were gazing skyward.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> silvery humming of a bell diverted
his attention from the
scene of congestion below him and,
turning away, he walked across the terrace
and into the great living room of
his luxurious abode.</p>
<p>Stepping to the televisor, he turned
a tiny switch, and the face of a girl
appeared in the glass panel that was
framed above the sound-box. He smiled
as he lifted the receiver and placed it
to his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Inga?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;You look as if you were expecting&ndash;&ndash;well,
almost anything disastrous.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dirk, what is that thing?&#8221; the
girl asked. &#8220;I really am frightened!&#8221;</p>
<p>He could see by the expression in
her blue eyes that she, too, was becoming
a victim of the hysteria that was
taking possession of many people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be alarmed, Inga,&#8221; he replied
reassuringly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
it is, and no one else seems to be able
to explain it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is frightful and uncanny,
Dirk,&#8221; the girl insisted, &#8220;and I am sure
that something terrible is going to happen.
I wish,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;that you
would come over and stay with me for
a little while. I am all alone and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Inga,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;I will
be with you in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver of the televisor
and clicked off the switch. The
image of the golden-haired girl to
whom he had been speaking slowly
faded from the glass.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Attiring</span> himself for a short
sixty-mile hop down Long Island,
Dirk passed out to the landing
stage and, stepping into the cabin of
his plane, he threw in the helicopter
lever. The machine rose straight into
the air for a couple of hundred feet
and then Dirk headed it westward to
where the nearest ascension beam sent
its red light towering toward the stars.
It marked a vertical air-lane that led
upward to the horizontal lanes of
flight.</p>
<p>Northbound ships flew between two
and four thousand feet; southbound
planes between five and seven thousand
feet; those eastbound confined themselves
to the level between nine and
eleven thousand feet, while the westbound
flyers monopolized the air between
twelve and fourteen thousand
feet.</p>
<p>All planes flying parallel to the
earth were careful to avoid those red
beacons which marked ascension
routes, and the shafts of green light
down which descending planes dropped
to the earth or into lower levels of
travel.</p>
<p>When Dirk&#8217;s altimeter indicated
seventy-five hundred feet he turned the
nose of his ship eastward and adjusted
his rheostat until his motors, fed by
wireless current, were revolving at top
speed.</p>
<p>The great canyons of Manhattan,
linked by arches and highways which
joined and passed through various
levels of the stupendous structures of
steelite and quartzite, passed swiftly
beneath him; and, after passing for a
few minutes over the deserted surface
of Long Island, he completed his
sixty-mile flight and brought his ship
to a rest on a landing stage that was
far up on the side of a vast pile that
rose up close to the shore of the Sound.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">As</span> soon as he stepped from the
door of the cabin he was joined
by a girl who, apparently, had been
lingering there, awaiting his arrival.</p>
<p>She was perhaps twenty years old,
and she had the golden hair, the light
complexion, and the blue eyes which
still were characteristic of the women
of northern Europe.</p>
<p>The slender lines of her exquisite
figure and the supple grace which she
displayed when she moved toward
Dirk were evidence, however, of the
Latin blood which was in her veins.</p>
<p>For Inga Fragoni, the daughter and
heiress of Orlando Fragoni, seemed to
be a culmination of all of the desirable
qualities of the women of the south
and those of the north.</p>
<p>The terrace on which Dirk had
landed was illuminated by lights which
simulated sunshine, and their soft
bright glow revealed the violet hue of
her eyes and the shimmering gloss of
her silken hair. She wore a sleeveless,
light blue tunic which was gathered
around her waist with a bejeweled
girdle.</p>
<p>On her tiny feet she wore <a name='TC_30'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'scandals'">sandals</ins>
which were spun of webby filaments
of gold and platinum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dirk, I am so glad that you are
here!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I felt so much
alone when I called you up. Dad is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
locked in the observatory with Professor
Nachbaren and three or four
other men and the servants&ndash;&ndash;well, they
all are so terrified that it simply alarms
me to have them around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is Stanton&#8217;s plane there,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Dirk, indicating a
powerful looking machine that stood
on the terrace.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">Y</span><span class="dcap">es,</span> Dirk,&#8221; the girl replied. &#8220;He
arrived here three or four minutes
before you did. I thought, at first,
that it was you coming. And Dirk,&#8221;
she continued, with a note of excitement
in her voice, &#8220;he flew up to look
at that thing, and I know that he is as
frightened about it as I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk grunted, but he gave no expression
of the dislike and distrust
that Stanton aroused in him. The latter,
he knew, was very much inclined
to look with favor on Inga, and his
presumption annoyed Dirk because,
while he and the girl had not declared
their intention of living together, they
were very much in love with each
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will want to hear him tell
about it, I know, Dirk,&#8221; the girl said.
&#8220;I left Stanton up on the garden terrace
when I saw you coming down.
Come; we will go and join him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk and Inga strolled slowly along
paths which were lined with exotic
shrubbery and plants. Here and there
a fountain tossed its glittering spray
high into the air while birds, invisible
in the feathery foliage, warbled and
thrilled entrancingly. Soft music,
transmitted from the auditoriums below,
blended so harmoniously with the
atmosphere of the terraces that it
seemed to mingle with and be a part of
the drifting, subtle scents of the
abundant flowers which bloomed on
every side.</p>
<p>For these upper terraces of Fragoni&#8217;s
palace were enclosed, during inclement
weather, with great glass plates which,
at the touch of a button, automatically
appeared or disappeared.</p>
<p>Winding their way easily upward,
Dirk and Inga came finally to a secluded
terrace which overlooked the
Sound. Here they saw Stanton, who
was unaware of their approach, looking
skyward at the dim and sinister shape
which was outlined against the sky.
Stanton&#8217;s brow was contracted and his
expression was filled with apprehension.
He started suddenly when he became
conscious of the presence of Dirk
and the lovely daughter of Fragoni.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet, a short man in
his forties, stocky in build and somewhat
swarthy in complexion. He contrasted
very unfavorably with Dirk,
who was tall and well-built and who
had abundant blond hair and steady
steel-blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of that thing,
Vanderpool?&#8221; he asked, almost ignoring
the presence of Inga.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know enough about it yet to
be able to express an opinion,&#8221; Dirk replied.
&#8220;We will find out about it soon
enough,&#8221; he added, &#8220;so why worry
about it in the meantime?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well enough to affect such an
attitude,&#8221; said Stanton, with a touch of
sarcasm in his voice, &#8220;but let me tell
you, Vanderpool, that there is good
reason to worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> frowned at the statement as
he saw a shadow pass over the
fair face of Inga.</p>
<p>&#8220;That thing up there,&#8221; continued
Stanton, with conviction in his voice,
&#8220;is not a natural phenomenon. I flew
fairly close to it in my plane and I
<a name='TC_31'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'knew'">know</ins> what I am speaking about. That
thing is some sort of a monster, Vanderpool,
that is made of metal or of
some composition that is an unearthly
equivalent of metal. It is a diabolical
creation of some sort that has come
from out of the fathomless depths of
the universe.&#8221; He shuddered at the
fantasy that his feverish imagination
was creating. &#8220;It is metal, I tell you,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;but it is metal that is
endowed with some sort of intelligence.
I was up there,&#8221; he breathed
swiftly, &#8220;and I saw it hanging there in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
the sky, quivering with heat and life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are nervous, Stanton,&#8221; said
Vanderpool coolly. &#8220;Get a grip on
yourself, man, and look at the thing
reasonably. If that thing has intelligence,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;we will find some
way to slay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slay it!&#8221; exclaimed Stanton. &#8220;How
can you expect to slay a mad creation
that can leap through space, from
world to world, like a wasp goes darting
from flower to flower? How can
you kill a thing which not only defies
absolute zero but also the immeasurable
heat which its friction with the
atmosphere generated when it plunged
toward the earth? How can you kill
a thing that seems to have brains and
nerves and bones and flesh of some
strange substance that is harder and
tougher than any earthly compound we
have discovered?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He stopped</span> speaking for a moment.
They listened to the voice that
was broadcasting from the Worldwide
Tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;our planes have approached to
within a few thousand feet of it and
are playing their searchlights over the
surface of the leviathan. It is not a
meteorite of any kind that scientists
have heretofore examined&ndash;&ndash;its surface
is smooth and unpitted and shows no
apparent effect of the tremendous heat
to which it was subjected during its
drop through the atmosphere. It seems
to be immune to gravity&ndash;&ndash;its weight
must be tremendous, and it is fully
three-quarters of a mile long and between
seven and eight hundred feet
in diameter at its widest part, but it
lies motionless&ndash;&ndash;motionless&ndash;&ndash;at about
forty thousand feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t appear now as if it
would prove very dangerous,&#8221; remarked
Dirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;and people are warned again to
maintain their composure and to go to
their homes and remain there for their
own protection and the protection of
others. Riots and serious disturbances
are reported from cities in all parts
of the world&ndash;&ndash;mobs are swarming the
streets of Manhattan and the other
boroughs of New York, and the police
are finding it difficult to restrain the
frenzied populations in other centers....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">There</span> was a pause, then, of some
moments, and then the voice of
the broadcaster, vibrant with excitement,
was heard again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;a plane has made a landing on the
surface of the monstrosity, which, it
seems, has not only lost its heat but is
becoming decidedly cold&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A servant appeared from among the
shrubbery and paused before Dirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a call for you, Mr. Vanderpool,&#8221;
he said respectfully.</p>
<p>Dirk excused himself and, entering
the sumptuous apartment that opened
from the terrace, went to the televisor.
He saw the face of Sears, the chief
secretary of Fragoni, in the glass
panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a meeting of the council
at nine o&#8217;clock in the morning, Mr.
Vanderpool,&#8221; came the voice over the
wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sears,&#8221; replied Dirk.
&#8220;It happens that Stanton is here at the
present time. Shall I notify him of the
conclave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will, please,&#8221; Sears responded.
&#8220;By the way, Mr. Vanderpool,
is there anything wrong at your
apartment? I tried to call you there
before I located you here and I failed
to get any response.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that all of my servants have
run out from under cover because of
their fear of that thing in the sky,&#8221;
Dirk responded. &#8220;Do you know anything
about it, Sears?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be discussed at the meeting
to-morrow morning,&#8221; replied Sears
shortly. &#8220;Good night, Mr. Vanderpool.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span>, upon returning to the terrace,
saw that both Stanton and
Inga were silently and fearfully looking
up into the night.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A meeting of the council at nine
o&#8217;clock in the morning, Stanton,&#8221; Dirk
said abruptly. &#8220;I told Sears I would
notify you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that we would be called
together very soon,&#8221; said Stanton. &#8220;It&#8217;s
concerning that damn thing up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; agreed Dirk carelessly.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I believe that I will
hop home and get some sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep!&#8221; exclaimed Stanton. &#8220;Sleep?
On a night like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dirk,&#8221; pleaded Inga, &#8220;stay here
with me, won&#8217;t you? I am not going
to bed because I just know that I
wouldn&#8217;t be able to close my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go, Inga, if he wants to
sleep,&#8221; urged Stanton. &#8220;I will stay
here and keep watch with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;and if order is not restored in the
streets of Manhattan within the course
of a short time, the authorities will resort
to morphite gas to quell the
turbulence and rioting&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The streets must be frightfully congested,&#8221;
said Inga. &#8220;It is the first occasion
in a long time that the police
have had to threaten the use of morphite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;we do not want to alarm people
unnecessarily but we have to report,&#8221;
came the hurried voice of the broadcaster,
&#8220;that the monstrous mass that
has been hanging above the city just
made a sudden drop of five thousand
feet and again came to a stop. It is
now a little more than six miles over
Manhattan and&ndash;&ndash;again it has dropped.
This time it fell like a plummet for
twelve thousand feet. It is now about
twenty thousand feet, some four miles,
above Manhattan and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A cry</span> of alarm came from the lips
of Inga as she gazed upward and
saw that gigantic, ominous-appearing
object loom dim and vast in the darkness
above them.</p>
<p>She went to Dirk and threw her arms
around him, as if she were clinging to
him for protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me, Dirk,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;I can just feel that something
terrible is going to happen, and I want
you with me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay with you, of course,&#8221; whispered
Dirk. Something of that feeling
of dread and apprehension which
so fully possessed his two companions
entered into his mind. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tremble
so, Inga,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;It is a strange
thing, but we will know more about it
in the morning. Be calm until then,
my dear, if you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked over the shoulder of the
girl, whose face was buried against his
breast, and he saw a hundred great red
and green shafts of light shooting up
into the air. Fleeting shadows seemed
to pass swiftly up and down them, and
he knew that thousands of planes were
abroad, some of them seeking the
heights and others dropping down.</p>
<p>The great towers of Long Island
were all aglow, and it was apparent
that few people were sleeping that
night. The scarlet sky over Manhattan
indicated that the center of the metropolis,
too, was alive to the menace of
the weird visitant that now was so
plainly visible.</p>
<p>All night long they remained on the
terrace. Dirk and <a name='TC_32'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Igna'">Inga</ins> seated close together
and Stanton, at a distance,
brooding alone over the disaster which
he felt was impending.</p>
<p>The illuminated dial of the great
clock that was a part of the beacon-tower
on the Metropole Landing Field
told of the slow passing of the hours.</p>
<p>All night long they listened to the
reports that came through the radiovisor
and watched that immobile,
threatening monster of metal.</p>
<p>But it remained static during the
rest of the night. And, with the coming
of a gray and sunless dawn, it still
hung there, motionless, silent and sinister.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> next morning the President
of the United States of the World,
from the capitol at The Hague, issued
a proclamation of martial law, to become
effective at once in all <a name='TC_33'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'part'">parts</ins> of the
world.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span></div>
<p>The edict forbade people to leave
their homes, and it was vigorously
executed, wherever the police themselves
were not in a state of demoralization.</p>
<p>At about the same time a special
meeting of the Supreme Congress was
called, the body to remain in session
until some solution of the mystery had
been arrived at.</p>
<p>At the same time that martial law
was declared, however, and the special
assemblage of lawmakers convened, a
statement was issued in which an attempt
was made to eliminate from the
minds of the people the idea that the
undefinable object above the metropolis
was at all dangerous.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, suggested that it very
probably was some sort of new device
which had been constructed on the
earth and which was being introduced
to the people of the world in a somewhat
sensational manner by the person
or persons who were responsible for it.</p>
<p>The fears of the populace were, to
some extent, allayed by this means, and
some degree of order restored.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">At</span> nine o&#8217;clock Dirk Vanderpool
was shown into the council chamber
in the palace of Orlando Fragoni,
and he was closely followed by Stanton.
Fragoni was already there, and
he greeted the two men with a countenance
that was serene but that,
nevertheless, revealed indications of
concern. He was a man past middle
age, tall and strikingly handsome in
appearance. His eyes were dark and
penetrating and his forehead, high and
wide, was crowned by an abundance of
snow-white hair. His voice, while
pleasing to the ear, was vibrant with
life and energy, and he spoke with the
incisive directness of one accustomed
to command.</p>
<p>For Orlando Fragoni, as nearly as
any one man might be, was the ruler
of the world.</p>
<p>It was in the early part of the twentieth
century that wealth had commenced
to concentrate into a relatively
few hands. This was followed by a
period in which vast mergers and consolidations
had been effected as a result
of the financial power and genius
for organization which a few men possessed.
A confederation of the countries
of the world was brought about
by industrial kings who had learned, in
one devastating war, that militarism,
while it might bring riches to a few,
was, in the final analysis, destructive
and wasteful.</p>
<p>Mankind the world over, relieved of
the menace of war, made more progress
in a decade than they had made in any
previous century, but all the time the
invisible concentration of power and
money continued.</p>
<p>And, in 1975, the affairs of the world
were controlled by five men, of whom
Orlando Fragoni was the most powerful
and most important.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">His</span> grandfather had been a small
banker, and out of his obscure
transactions the great House of
Fragoni had arisen. The money power
of the world was now controlled by
Orlando Fragoni. Dirk Vanderpool,
partly as a result of a vast inheritance
and partly through his own ability and
untiring industry, dominated the transportation
facilities of the world. Planes
and Zeppelins, railroad equipment and
ships, were built in his plants and
operated by the many organizations
which he controlled.</p>
<p>Stanton had inherited the agricultural
activities of the world and, in addition
to this, he was the sovereign of
distribution. He owned immense acreages
in all of the continents; he not
only cultivated every known variety of
produce, but also handled the sale of
his products through his own great
chains of stores. His father had been
one of the great geniuses of the preceding
generation, but Stanton, while
inheriting the commercial empire
which he had ruled, had not inherited
much of the ability which had gone
into the establishment of it.</p>
<p>There were two other members of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
that invisible council of Five, the very
existence of which was not even suspected
by the general populace of the
world.</p>
<p>Sigmund Lazarre was the world&#8217;s
mightiest builder, and millions of great
structures, which were built of material
from his own mines, were under
his control. It was Lazarre, too, who
owned the theaters and other amusement
centers in which millions upon
millions of people sought relaxation
every day. The creation and application
of electrical power made up the
domain of Wilhelm Steinholt, who also
owned the factories that made the machinery
of the world.</p>
<p>Absolute control of all of the necessities
and luxuries of life, in fact, were
in the hands of the five men, who used
their vast power wisely and beneficently.</p>
<p>Ostensibly the peoples of the world
ruled themselves by means of a democratic
form of government.</p>
<p>In reality their lives were directed
by a few men whose power and wealth
were entirely unsuspected by any but
those who were close to them.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> council room in which
Fragoni had received Dirk and
Stanton was lofty and sumptuously appointed.</p>
<p>The rugs which covered the floor
were soft to the tread, and the walls
and ceiling were adorned with a series
of murals which represented the various
heavenly constellations.</p>
<p>At the far end of the chamber there
was a staircase, and Dirk was among
those who knew that it led up to the
great observatory in which Fragoni
and certain of his scientific associates
spent so much of their time at night.</p>
<p>For men had commenced to talk
about the conquest of the stars, and it
was generally believed that it would
not be many years more before a way
would be found to traverse the interplanetary
spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are rather fortunate, my
friends,&#8221; Fragoni said to his two associates,
&#8220;to have been the witnesses of
the event that transpired last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunate!&#8221; exclaimed Stanton.
&#8220;Then you know that the thing is
harmless?&#8221;</p>
<p>A little smile lit the benign and
scholarly countenance of Fragoni as he
calmly regarded Stanton.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know very little about it,&#8221; he
replied after a brief pause, &#8220;and, if our
surmises are correct, it may be very
far from harmless. It is intensely interesting,
nevertheless,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;because that thing, as you term it, unquestionably
is directed by intelligence.
Without the slightest doubt
the people of the earth are about to behold
a form of life from some far-away
planet. What that form will be,&#8221; he
added, with an almost imperceptible
shrug of his shoulders, &#8220;it is impossible
to forecast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was so hot,&#8221; commenced
Stanton, &#8220;that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; agreed Fragoni, &#8220;but it also
is large and it may be that only the
outer shell of it was affected by friction
with the atmosphere that surrounds
the earth. Nachbaren,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;is certain that there is intelligent
life within it; and Nachbaren,&#8221; he
added dryly, &#8220;is usually right.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">While</span> Fragoni had been speaking,
two more men had quietly
joined them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Lazarre,&#8221; Fragoni
said, addressing a short, swarthy man
who, very apparently, was of Jewish
extraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; the other replied in
a soft and <a name='TC_34'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'melifluous'">mellifluous</ins> voice. &#8220;It seems,&#8221;
he continued, with a twinkle in his
eyes, &#8220;as if some of my pretty buildings
may be toppled over soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; agreed Fragoni. &#8220;And
maybe,&#8221; he added more seriously,
&#8220;much more than your buildings will
be toppled over, Lazarre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That thing, then, is...?&#8221; questioned
the heavy-set, slow-speaking,
blue-eyed Teuton who had come into
the room with Lazarre.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We do not know, Steinholt,&#8221; admitted
Fragoni, &#8220;but our knowledge
undoubtedly will be increased considerably
within the next few hours.
And now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will consider
the problem at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;the object which has created such
unrest is slowly rising. It is now some
twenty-five thousand feet above Manhattan.
It is&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice from the radiovisor attracted
the attention of the five men,
and, with one accord, they rushed to
the terrace and looked toward Manhattan.
They saw the great leviathan
high in the air for a moment, and then,
suddenly, it seemed to vanish from
sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; exclaimed Stanton, with
a sigh of relief. &#8220;It must have been
some odd atmospheric freak, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>They searched the skies through the
luciscope that was on the terrace, but
failed to detect any trace of the
monster.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">T</span><span class="dcap">hat</span> seems to simplify matters,&#8221;
remarked Fragoni as they
again walked back into the great conference
room. But here, once more,
they heard the voice from the Worldwide
Tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;we are advised by Chicago that
the thing, dull-red with heat, is hovering
only a couple of thousand feet over
the city. Thousands in the streets are
being killed by the heat it is radiating&ndash;&ndash;panic
reigns, despite a rigorous enforcement
of martial law. The strange
object just rose suddenly to a high altitude
and disappeared&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s another one of those damned
things,&#8221; asserted Stanton. &#8220;That
couldn&#8217;t go a thousand miles a minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can go faster than that, if I am
not mistaken,&#8221; said Fragoni. And it
presently appeared that he was right,
for in a couple of minutes the radiovisor
transmitted the news that it was
over San Francisco, where it remained
for only a few seconds. It was not
more than a minute later that word
came from Shanghai that it had passed
slowly over that city. Then again it
was poised high over Manhattan, crimson
with heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any possible defense
against it, Steinholt?&#8221; Fragoni asked.
The Teuton shook his head with an
air of finality.</p>
<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as far as I can determine
now. We can create and direct
artificial lightning that would reduce
this building to a mass of powdered
stone and fused metal in a fraction
of a second. But I am certain
that it wouldn&#8217;t leave as much as a
scratch on that monster up there. We
might try the Z-Rays on it, but an intelligence
that could devise such a craft
would undoubtedly have the wisdom to
protect it against such an elementary
menace as rays. Even the mightiest
explosives that we have wouldn&#8217;t send
a tremor through that mighty mass.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hy</span> not await developments?&#8221;
asked Dirk. &#8220;We do not even
know the nature of the thing we are
trying to combat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s solid metal,&#8221; insisted Stanton
tenaciously. &#8220;It&#8217;s a metal body with
a metal brain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous,&#8221; said Steinholt.
&#8220;It seems quite apparent that the craft
has come from another planet, and, if
I am not greatly mistaken, there are
intelligent creatures inside it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any event,&#8221; said Dirk, &#8220;it seems
impractical to make any plans until
we know more about it. I suggest that
we empower Fragoni to act for the
rest of us in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very agreeable to me,&#8221; said
Steinholt. &#8220;A crisis very possibly
may arise in which the quick judgment
of one man may be necessary to avert
the danger that always is inherent in
delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hold my proxy,&#8221; Lazarre said
to Fragoni, &#8220;and I assume that Stanton
is agreeable to this procedure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;the thing is moving very slowly
eastward in the direction of Long
Island Sound. It is, at the same time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
losing altitude. Its movements are being
carefully watched. As yet we see
no cause for immediate alarm&ndash;&ndash;people
are advised to remain calm&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am agreeable,&#8221; said Stanton
nervously and hastily. &#8220;If there are
things in it with which we can compromise,
I would suggest that we do
not offend them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, then, empowered to act for
all of you,&#8221; said Fragoni, ignoring the
suggestion of Stanton.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> rose from his chair and walked
out on the terrace. The others
followed after him.</p>
<p>Looking westward, they saw the
mammoth craft descending slowly in
their direction.</p>
<p>Its vast dimensions became more and
more apparent as, spellbound, they
watched it approach closer and closer
to them.</p>
<p>The thing in the sky was now not
more than three thousand feet above
them and only a few miles to the westward.</p>
<p>The observers on the terrace regarded
it for a moment in silence as it
drifted forward and downward.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s colossal!&#8221; <a name='TC_35'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Steinhold'">Steinholt</ins> then exclaimed,
lost in scientific admiration of
the mammoth craft. &#8220;Magnificent!
Superb!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s coming right toward us!&#8221;
cried Stanton.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes it move, I wonder?&#8221;
asked Dirk. &#8220;And how in the world
is it controlled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely is not of this world,&#8221; said
Fragoni quietly. &#8220;That gigantic thing
has come to us from somewhere out
of the infinite and terrible depths of
space.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Another</span> minute elapsed while
they watched it, speechless with
wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; Lazarre then said
calmly, &#8220;I believe that it is going to
land in the waters of the Sound. It
appears so to me, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearly opposite them by this
time, and not more than a thousand
feet above the water. A few planes
which, very apparently, were being
flown by intrepid and fearless flyers,
were hovering close around it.</p>
<p>Then finally it came to rest, as Lazarre
had predicted, in the water some
two miles off shore, and it was obscured
by a great cloud of vapor for several
minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steam,&#8221; asserted Steinholt. &#8220;That
trip around the world, which it made
in a few minutes, generated considerable
frictional heat in the shell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Fragoni, &#8220;we&#8217;ll fly out
and look the thing over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around the corner of the building,
on the level of the terrace, there was
a landing stage which was occupied by
a number of planes of various sizes.</p>
<p>Dirk entered the door of a small
twenty passenger speedster, and the
others filed in after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; he asked, after he had seated
himself at the controls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221; replied Fragoni.</p>
<p>The plane rose straight up into the
air and then darted gracefully out over
the Sound.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> swooped straight down at the
leviathan which lay so quietly
on the surface of the Sound and then
slowly circled around it. No sign of
an aperture of any sort could be seen
in the craft. Then he dropped the
plane lightly on the water, close to the
metallic monster, which towered fully
four hundred feet above them, despite
the fact that more than half of it was
submerged.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be hollow,&#8221; remarked Steinholt,
&#8220;or it wouldn&#8217;t be so far out of
the water. In fact, it most certainly
would sink, if it was solid.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the touch of a lever which lay
under one of Dirk&#8217;s hands the plane
rose straight out of the water, and he
maneuvered it directly over the top of
the strange enigma. Then he touched
a button and the pontoons were drawn
up into the undercarriage of the craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I make a landing on it?&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
asked, turning his head and addressing
Fragoni.</p>
<p>The latter nodded his head, and Dirk
dropped the ship gently onto the
smooth surface of the monster, the
pneumatic gearing completely absorbing
the shock of the landing.</p>
<p>Dirk relinquished the controls and,
opening the door of the cabin, he
stepped out onto the rough and pitted
substance of which the leviathan was
compounded. He stood there while the
others came out after him.</p>
<p>A large area on the top of the monster
was perfectly flat and, within a
very few moments, Dirk discovered
that it was decidedly warm. He had
brought the plane down close to the
middle of the length of the strange
craft in the belief that there, if anywhere,
some indication of an entrance
might be found.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> voice of Steinholt, tense with
suppressed excitement, appraised
him that his surmise had been correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a manhole of some sort,&#8221;
the electrical wizard exclaimed. &#8220;And
look, it is turning!&#8221;</p>
<p>They saw, not far ahead of them, a
circular twelve-foot section of the deck
slowly revolving, and, even as they
watched, it commenced to rise slowly
upward as the threads with which it
was provided turned gradually around.</p>
<p>Almost involuntarily they retreated
a few feet and stood there, spellbound,
as they stared at the massive, revolving
section of the deck.</p>
<p>It continued to turn until fully ten
feet of the mobile cylinder had been
exposed. Then the bottom of it appeared.
Even then it continued to revolve
and rise on a comparatively small
shaft which supported it and, at the
same time, thrust it upward. Dirk and
his companions kept their eyes on the
rim of the well which had been exposed,
and awaited the appearance of
something, they knew not what. When
the top of the great cylinder was fully
twelve feet above the deck of the craft
it slowly ceased to revolve.</p>
<p>Moment succeeded moment as the
members of the little group rigidly and
almost breathlessly awaited developments.</p>
<p>Then Dirk, with an impatient ejaculation,
stepped forward toward the
yawning hole and cautiously peered
over the edge of it.</p>
<p>He stood there for a moment, as if
transfixed, and then, with an exclamation
of horror, retreated swiftly to
where his friends were standing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hat</span> is it?&#8221; gasped Steinholt.
&#8220;What did you see when&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the words died on his lips for,
swarming swiftly over every side of
the well, there poured an array of erect,
piercing-eyed beings, who had all the
characteristics of humans. They were
clad in tight-fitting attire of thin and
pliant metal which, with the exception
of their faces, shielded them from
head to foot. On their heads they
wore close-fitting helmets, apparently
equipped with visors which could be
drawn down to cover their unprepossessing
features.</p>
<p>Each one of them carried a tube
which bore a striking resemblance to
a portable electric flashlight.</p>
<p>Swiftly they advanced, in ranks of
eight, toward Dirk and his companions
who, gripped with amazement, held
their positions.</p>
<p>The first line came to a halt not
more than four feet from the little
group on the deck. The other lines
halted, too, and formed a great platoon.
Then a shrill whistle sounded and the
formation parted in the middle, leaving
an open path that led backward
to the entrance, to the well.</p>
<p>A moment later the watchers saw the
regal figure of a man emerge from the
orifice and, after a moment&#8217;s pause, advance
slowly in their direction with a
stately stride.</p>
<p>He was tall and muscular and blond
and his attire, golden in texture, glittered
with sparkling gems.</p>
<p>As he approached them he raised his
right hand and, inasmuch as his countenance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
was calm and benign, his gesture
appeared to be one of peace and
good-will.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Following</span> close behind him
there was a younger man who, very
apparently, was of the same lineage.
His expression, however, was petulant
and haughty and it contained more
than a suggestion of rapacity and evil.</p>
<p>Behind him there were others of the
same fair type, all of them sumptuously
and ornately attired.</p>
<p>Fragoni stepped forward, himself a
dignified and striking figure, as the
leader of the strange adventurers came
forth from the lane that had been
formed by his immobile guard of warriors.</p>
<p>The two men confronted each other,
one whose power and wealth gave him
a dominate position on earth, and the
other a personage from some domain
that was remote in the abyss of space.</p>
<p>Fragoni bowed and spoke a few
friendly words of welcome and the
stranger, to the utter amazement of
the banker and his associates, responded
in an English that was rather peculiar
in accent but that they could understand
without any difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what part of the world do
you come,&#8221; asked the astounded Fragoni,
&#8220;that you speak our language?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We come from no part of this
world,&#8221; replied the stranger. &#8220;The empire
of my ruler is infinitely far away.
But language, my friend, is not a thing
of accident. Life grows out of the
substance of the universe and language
comes out of life. The speech of mankind,
in your state of development,
varies but little throughout all space
and I have heard your English, as you
call it, spoken among those who dwell
in many, many worlds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your world?&#8221; asked Steinholt
with avid curiosity. &#8220;Tell us of the
planet from which you come.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">But</span> Fragoni, smiling at the eagerness
of Steinholt, interposed with
a kindly but arresting gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Fragoni,&#8221; he said to the
stranger, &#8220;and I would have you partake,
of my hospitality and refresh
yourself after your long journey.
These,&#8221; he added, &#8220;are my friends,
Steinholt, Vanderpool and Lazarre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Teuxical, vassal of his Supreme
Highness, Malfero of Lodore,&#8221;
the other replied. &#8220;This is my son,
Zitlan,&#8221; he continued, indicating the
young man behind him, &#8220;and the others
are my high captains, Anteucan,
Orzitza and Huazibar. More of my
officers are below together with ten
thousand armed and armored men such
as you see before you.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the last part of the statement was
intended as a threat or a warning, the
expression on Fragoni&#8217;s face gave no
indication that he was aware of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You carry a large crew, sir,&#8221; Fragoni
replied, &#8220;but we gladly will make
provisions for all of your men. As
for yourself, your son, and your captains,
if you will come with me....&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded in the direction of the
plane which rested on the great interplanetary
vessel and started to walk
slowly in the direction of it. The
leader of the skymen walked by his
side and the other men from Lodore
followed close after them.</p>
<p>Dirk, Steinholt and Lazarre brought
up the rear, while the soldiers remained
motionless in their serried array.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Innumerable</span> planes were circling
overhead and hundreds of
them had landed on the water in the
vicinity. Dirk saw that the wanderers
from the stars regarded them curiously
as if they never before had seen aircraft
of that particular type.</p>
<p>When the cabin door of the plane
was thrown open, Teuxical turned to
one of his captains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remain here, Anteucan, with the
soldiers,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;and await
our return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teuxical then entered the plane with
his men and Fragoni, Steinholt and Lazarre
followed after them. Then Dirk
took his seat at the controls.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span></div>
<p>&#8220;These are strange craft you use,&#8221;
he heard Teuxical say. &#8220;I have seen
them in only one of the multitude of
other worlds on which I have set my
feet, worlds which all pay tribute to
Malfero of Lodore. It is safer and
swifter to ride the magnetic currents
than it is to ride the unstable currents
of the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk caught the significance of the
reference to tribute and he admired
the clever diplomacy of Teuxical while,
at the same time, he wondered if the
earth and all of those who dwelt upon
it were doomed to fall under the sway
of some remote and unseen despot.</p>
<p>He also realized that the Lodorians
had, in some way, devised a craft that
rode the great magnetic streams which
flowed through the universe in much
the same way that men, in ships, navigated
the streams of the earth.</p>
<p>He threw on the helicopter switch
and the plane rose swiftly into the air,
the myriad other flying craft which
were circling nearby keeping at a safe
distance from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land on the grand terrace,&#8221; Fragoni
directed. The flight was short
and rapid and it was only a matter of
seconds before Dirk brought the plane
down on the landing stage which they
had left only a scant half-hour before.</p>
<p>He opened the cabin door and
stepped out of the plane and the others
filed out after him.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Fragoni</span> led the way along the
stage, walking and chatting with
Teuxical, and Dirk, following after the
others, was the last to turn a corner
that brought him a sweeping view of
the magnificent terrace that fronted the
private apartments of the banker and
his daughter.</p>
<p>And, when he did, he saw that Inga
was standing there, superbly beautiful,
with Stanton a few paces behind her.</p>
<p>Her lovely eyes were alive with awe
and wonder and her slender white
hands were crossed over her heart.</p>
<p>And Dirk saw, too, that Zitlan, son
of Teuxical, had paused and was standing
quite still, with his unwavering and
insolent eyes fixed on the girl. Resentment,
and a touch of apprehension,
agitated Dirk when he saw the expression
on the face of the young Lodorian.</p>
<p>There was admiration in that disagreeable
countenance, but it was
blended with arrogance, haughtiness
and ill-concealed desire.</p>
<p>Dirk went quickly to Inga, standing
between the girl and the one from
Lodore who was staring at her so brazenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it all mean, Dirk?&#8221; she
asked in a low voice. &#8220;Those strange
people, where are they from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanton had come quickly forward
and had joined Inga and Dirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are from some far-off world,
Inga,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;that we know
nothing about as yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do they want?&#8221; she persisted.
&#8220;What do they intend to do?
I saw those horrible creatures through
the magnascope when they came
swarming out of the inside of that
thing on the water and I thought, at
first, that they were going to kill you
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they seem to come in peace,&#8221;
Dirk replied. &#8220;Teuxical, their leader,
seems to be gracious and kindly.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">e</span> are all doomed,&#8221; asserted
Stanton, &#8220;unless something
happens. They can crumble our cities
with heat and bury us under the ruins
of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your silence!&#8221; breathed Dirk,
quietly but tensely. &#8220;We will find a
way to destroy those creatures if it
becomes necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man who keeps staring at me,
who is he?&#8221; asked Inga in a voice that
betrayed her nervousness.</p>
<p>Dirk turned and saw that Zitlan was
still standing where he had paused and
that he still was looking with searching
eyes in the direction of the girl.</p>
<p>He returned the insolent gaze of the
young Lodorian with an impatient and
threatening stare and the countenance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
of Zitlan at once became stern and
menacing. He came striding in the
direction of Inga, Dirk and Stanton
and paused within a few feet of them,
his rapacious eyes still fixed on the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;My lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your beauty
pleases me. I have walked on many
worlds but never before have I seen
one as lovely as yourself. Of the spoils
of this world, all that I crave possession
of is you. When we return to
Lodore,&#8221; he added with an air of finality,
&#8220;I will take you with me and place
you with my other women in the Seraglio
of the Stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk swiftly stepped close to Zitlan
and the latter quickly clasped a tube
that hung at his side, a tube of the
sort that the soldiers had carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your words and your manner are
insolent,&#8221; asserted Dirk angrily, &#8220;and
I warn you now to cease making yourself
offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dog!&#8221; exclaimed Zitlan fiercely,
leveling the metal tube, &#8220;I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the left fist of Dirk cut short
his threat as it made a sudden impact
with his chin, and the Lodorian went
crashing backward into some exotic
shrubbery with a look of surprise on
his countenance.</p>
<p>Then Dirk heard an odd hissing and
crackling sound, and he felt himself
becoming dizzy and weak.</p>
<p>Darkness seemed to sweep in upon
him; he felt that he was dropping
swiftly through space, and then he lost
consciousness.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A vague</span> and shadowy figure was
standing close by his side and
peering down into his face. After a
while he realized that it was Steinholt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steinholt!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;why
am I here&ndash;&ndash;in Fragoni&#8217;s? I must have
had a dream&ndash;&ndash;and yet....&#8221;</p>
<p>He furrowed his brow in thought
and, gradually, he commenced to remember
what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was no dream,&#8221; said the scientist
softly. &#8220;Do you remember the trouble
that you had with Zitlan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Dirk. &#8220;I remember
that he was insolent to Inga and that
I lost my temper and struck him. But
what happened to me? I don&#8217;t recall
that anybody hit me. I did hear sort
of a peculiar sound just before I started
to pass out, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teuxical took a shot at you,&#8221; said
Steinholt, &#8220;and you have been unconscious
for over thirty-six hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Took a shot at me!&#8221; exclaimed
Dirk. &#8220;What did he shoot me with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what we all would like to
know,&#8221; said Steinholt. &#8220;He leveled
one of those damn tubes at you and
pressed a button on it. There was a
hissing sound, a flash of light, and you
got groggy, and went out. He potted
Zitlan, too,&#8221; continued Steinholt, &#8220;and
he apologized for the trouble that his
son was responsible for. Do you
know,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I sort of like the
old man.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Lazarre</span>, with a sympathetic
smile on his face, entered the
room at that moment and overheard
the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old man is right,&#8221; he remarked,
with a little note of awe in his voice.
&#8220;Teuxical admits that he is three thousand
years old and that he has at least
two thousand more ahead of him. That
Lodore must be a queer world,&#8221; he
commented, shaking his grizzly head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not so queer when you take
everything into consideration,&#8221; said
Steinholt. &#8220;It seems quite natural
when Teuxical explains it. Lodore it
seems, is something like a hundred
thousand times as big as this miniature
world we live on. It took Lodore
infinitely longer to solidify from a gaseous
state than it took this world, and
its entire evolution has been relatively
slower than ours. Therefore, according
to Teuxical, the people up there
live longer and, incidentally, know infinitely
more than we do.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hat</span> time is it now?&#8221; asked
Dirk, after a moment of
thought.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is just about twelve o&#8217;clock at
night,&#8221; Steinholt informed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have these Lodorians made any demands
yet?&#8221; Dirk asked. &#8220;Does anybody
know what they are going to do
or what they want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are liable to do almost anything,&#8221;
said Lazarre, &#8220;and it looks as
though they will be able to get anything
that they want. Teuxical, as I
understand it, just gave you a slight
shock with his death-ray device. If
he had pulled the trigger all the way
you would have become just a little
pile of dust that the first breeze would
have blown away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our own death-rays are somewhat
similar,&#8221; said Steinholt, &#8220;but they are
not a hundredth as powerful. And
they won&#8217;t work on the Lodorians,
either,&#8221; he added, &#8220;because those metal
sheaths that they wear make them immune
to all kinds of destructive rays.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">I</span><span class="dcap">t</span> appears,&#8221; remarked Lazarre morosely,
&#8220;as if this little world of
ours is going to be taken for a ride.
And it&#8217;s too bad, considering that it&#8217;s
the only world we&#8217;ve got. There has
been no formal presentation of demands
yet, but it seems to be sort of
understood that the earth is going to
become a tributary of Lodore. It is a
good thing,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that Teuxical,
and not Zitlan, is the boss of that outfit.
I don&#8217;t like the looks of that
young fellow. He&#8217;s only twelve hundred
years old and he is sort of hot-blooded,
I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking with Anteucan,&#8221; said
Steinholt, &#8220;and he told me that the
Lodorians usually make heavy levies
on worlds which they discover and
dominate. As soon as Teuxical returns
to Lodore and announces a new discovery
a fleet of those damned monsters
is sent out to mop up the new planet.
That Malfero, who is the emperor of
Lodore, is considerable of a monarch,
and it seems that he has a passion for
piling up wealth. Gold and platinum
are as precious on Lodore as they are
here and he also likes pretty stones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is worse,&#8221; added Steinholt,
&#8220;is his practice of enslaving entire
populations and making toilers or
warriors out of them. Those soldiers
on the ship are not Lodorians. Millions
of them were seized on some
planet and converted into troops. It
was a strange conversion, too,&#8221; said
Steinholt with a shudder. &#8220;Their
brains were operated on and most of
their faculties removed. They have no
sense of fear, no consciences, no power
of reasoning. They respond only to
certain signals on a whistle and their
only definite and active impulse is that
of murder and destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to do,&#8221; said Dirk
positively, &#8220;but to kill all of these interlopers,
if we hope to save our world
from being desolated.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> three men looked at each other
in silence for a moment and then
Dirk, somewhat weakly, rose into a
sitting position in the bed which he
had been occupying.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how,&#8221; asked Steinholt, &#8220;can we
kill them? We might, of course, get
rid of a few of them, but that simply
would lead to our destruction by those
who were left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be some way,&#8221; asserted
Dirk, &#8220;and it is up to us to think of
it without delay. If we let those
Lodorians get a foothold on the world
all will be lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man seems to be reasonable
enough,&#8221; said Lazarre. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t
seem inclined to be destructive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must not trust him or any of
the others,&#8221; said Dirk imperatively.
&#8220;We must rid the earth of every one
of them. And the sooner we strike the
better!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It had best be soon if it is to be at
all,&#8221; said Steinholt. &#8220;Fragoni has arranged
to have Teuxical appear before
the Congress, and the meeting has been
called for to-night when, I imagine,
certain specific demands will be made
upon us. We all will go to The Hague
together on the ship of the Lodorians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we leave?&#8221; questioned Dirk.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The meeting is set for ten P.&nbsp;M.,
New York time,&#8221; said Lazarre. &#8220;We
will start east at about four o&#8217;clock in
the morning, I guess, because it will
only take a minute or so to arrive at
our destination.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Fragoni going?&#8221; asked Dirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; replied Lazarre.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Inga?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so,&#8221; Lazarre told him.
&#8220;Fragoni was both afraid to take her
and to leave her behind, but finally he
decided that he wanted her with him in
case of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">A</span><span class="dcap">nd</span> are they&ndash;&ndash;the Lodorians&ndash;&ndash;still
here?&#8221; queried Dirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded Lazarre. &#8220;Teuxical
returned to his ship last night with
Zitlan and his other followers, but they
came back late this afternoon, and they
are still here. Zitlan seemed to be all
right this afternoon, too. They must
have used some means of bringing him
out of the daze that he was in. We
did everything we could to revive you,
but none of our measures were effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right now,&#8221; asserted Dirk,
as he finished attiring himself. &#8220;I want
to see Fragoni at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go out on the terrace then,&#8221;
said Steinholt. &#8220;They are all out
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk, with his two companions,
strolled out through the maze of rooms
and corridors that led to the garden
which hung so high above the city and
the Sound below it.</p>
<p>The first thing that Dirk saw, when
he passed out onto the terrace, was the
white tunic of Inga, who was leaning
against a coping and talking with
Zitlan.</p>
<p>The latter was pointing skyward and,
very apparently, he was telling her of
worlds which circled high among the
stars.</p>
<p>As if she were suddenly aware of his
presence, Inga turned and saw Dirk
and he realized, by the expression on
her face, that she was distraught and
nervous. She came toward him quickly,
after a few words to Zitlan, and the
face of the latter darkened. There was
hatred in his expression as he stared
malevolently at Dirk.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Steinholt</span> and Lazarre passed
along and joined Fragoni and
Teuxical, who were the center of a
group that had formed in another part
of the terrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dirk,&#8221; said Inga, &#8220;I am so
afraid of that frightful Zitlan. He has
been telling me again that he is going
to take me back to his own world with
him and it makes me shudder to think
of it. He is so strange and queer and
his eyes are so terrible. He can&#8217;t be as
young as he looks, because he speaks
of years like we speak of minutes. I
will die if I ever find myself in that
monster&#8217;s power! He has been telling
me of all the creatures he has slain on
the worlds on which he has landed, and
I tell you, Dirk, that he is cruel and
ruthless and horrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will never have you!&#8221; swore
Dirk. &#8220;And if I hear of any more of
his insolence, I will throw him headlong
from this terrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Dirk,&#8221; she begged, &#8220;don&#8217;t
do anything&ndash;&ndash;not yet. He is utterly
unscrupulous, Dirk. He told me that,
even now, he is plotting against some
Malfero who rules Lodore like a god,
and that he is planning to seize the
throne of the planet. He wants to make
me the queen of that fearful world
when he becomes king. He boasted
that, if I were on the throne, millions
of people from other worlds would be
sacrificed in my honor in the temples
of Lodore.&#8221; Her voice trembled and
her eyes were terror-stricken as she
continued. &#8220;They tear out the hearts
of living victims,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;and
burn them on their high and mammoth
pyramids.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Rage</span> took possession of Dirk and,
casting a glance at Zitlan, he saw
that the Lodorian was smiling insolently
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill that beast, if it&#8217;s the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
thing that I do!&#8221; he exclaimed to Inga.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dirk, Dirk,&#8221; she implored, &#8220;don&#8217;t
even look at him. He is proud and impetuous,
and he will kill you in defiance
of his own father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will find some way to rid the
world of the scourge that has descended
upon it,&#8221; asserted Dirk confidently,
&#8220;and he will die with the rest of that
monstrous crew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going in, Dirk,&#8221; Inga said.
&#8220;Please,&#8221; she begged, &#8220;don&#8217;t do anything
rash. If&ndash;&ndash;something&ndash;&ndash;should
happen to you, I would lose all the
hope that I have and I would, I think,
kill myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose hope, my dear,&#8221; said Dirk
reassuringly. &#8220;I believe that I know
of a way to destroy the plague that
menaces us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pressed her hand and, after she
left him, he walked over and joined
the other men on the terrace. Zitlan,
coming from the terrace wall, stretched
out in a chair not far from Dirk.</p>
<p>Teuxical regarded the latter with
a countenance that was calm and
amicable. &#8220;I am sorry, my young
friend,&#8221; he apologized, &#8220;that I had to
intervene between you and my son.&#8221;
He paused a moment and sat in silence,
a thoughtful expression on his face.
&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he then said, &#8220;what disasters
have arisen out of the desire of men
for women. In my wanderings over
the starlit worlds, I have seen....&#8221; He
ceased speaking, brooded for a moment,
and then shook his head slowly.
&#8220;But you cannot say that I was not
just,&#8221; he continued, addressing Dirk.
&#8220;I punished Zitlan for his presumption.
Fragoni tells me that the woman
has pledged herself to you. Let her
pledge be kept!&#8221; he exclaimed sternly,
looking straight at Zitlan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the conquerors,&#8221; asserted
the latter boldly, &#8220;and to us should belong
the spoils of our daring!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; thundered Teuxical. &#8220;My
own son, above all others, shall be
obedient to my commands! Or, like
others have done, he shall die because
of insubordination!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Zitlan</span>, a defiant expression on
his face, ceased to speak, but Dirk
could see that he was livid with suppressed
rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; Teuxical remarked,
turning to Fragoni, &#8220;I am getting
old and long have I been weary
of conquest. I have seen your world
and it pleases me. It is a tiny and
peaceful place, far removed from the
strife and turbulence of the restless
centers of the universe. So it is my
will to leave you unscathed and return
to Lodore for a brief time to ask of the
mighty Malfero the grant of this little
provincial land. And then, with his
permission, I will return here and rule
it with wisdom and benevolence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will bring to you much knowledge,
and peace will be to the people of this
earth and peace will be to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; replied Fragoni. &#8220;No
world, I am certain, could hope for a
wiser and more just ruler than yourself,
and our Congress surely will receive
you with acclaim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teuxical bowed in recognition of the
compliment, and his countenance indicated
that he was gratified.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go, now, back to our vessel,&#8221;
he said, addressing the other
Lodorians. &#8220;We will return for you
at the appointed hour and conduct you
to our ship,&#8221; he added, speaking to
Fragoni.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be ready,&#8221; Fragoni replied.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Zitlan</span> had arisen with the rest of
them and Dirk, with a look of
contempt and amusement in his eyes,
regarded him casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have the honor of conducting
our guests back to their ship in a
plane?&#8221; Stanton requested of Fragoni.</p>
<p>The latter nodded and Stanton
walked across the terrace in the direction
of the landing stage.</p>
<p>Zitlan, as he followed after the
others, passed close to Dirk and, pausing
for a moment, fixed his hateful eyes
on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dog,&#8221; he whispered malignantly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
&#8220;remember what I tell you! The
time will come when I will cast you
to the carnaphlocti in the dark and icy
caverns of sunless Tiganda. You will
die,&#8221; he swore, &#8220;the death of a million
agonies!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Dirk felt an almost irresistible
impulse to hurl himself on
the Lodorian and slay him.</p>
<p>He managed to maintain his control,
however, and only regarded Zitlan with
disdain as the latter turned and went
on his way.</p>
<p>In another moment the plane, containing
Stanton and the Lodorians, was
high up in the darkness.</p>
<p>Dirk glanced at the great clock that
gleamed atop of the beacon-tower on
the Metropole Landing Field.</p>
<p>The hour was close to twelve-thirty
A.&nbsp;M.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A moment</span> of silence on the terrace
followed the departure of
the plane that bore the Lodorians back
to their craft.</p>
<p>For an hour the clouds had been
gathering in the sky and now a fine,
cold rain commenced to fall.</p>
<p>A peal of thunder echoed above them
after a sharp flash of lightning had
streaked across the black night above
them.</p>
<p>A servant appeared from the entrance
to the apartment and pressed a
button close to the door.</p>
<p>Protective plates of glass noiselessly
enveloped the terrace, sheltering those
upon it from the inclement weather.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; remarked Fragoni,
breaking the silence, &#8220;that we were
found by a leader like Teuxical. Our
tribute will not be unbearable, and he
will bestow many benefits upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; protested Dirk, &#8220;you
do not intend to surrender without a
struggle! Nothing but disaster,&#8221; he
asserted earnestly, &#8220;will come upon the
earth if you do. Teuxical may be
honest and just but, after all, he
neither is immortal nor all-powerful,
and something may happen to him at
any moment. And there are those like
Zitlan who would turn the world over
to ravage and rape, and then convert it
into a blazing pyre, if they had their
way. These vandals,&#8221; he insisted,
&#8220;must be slain one and all, or, mark
my words, our world will be laid
waste.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> spoke with such a sense of
conviction that his words held
his listeners spellbound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Teuxical,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;but
the vassal of a monarch whose corsairs,
very apparently, are carrying on a war
of conquest in the universe? It will
be disastrous, I say, to place any dependence
in the good will of this one
Lodorian. If he, or any of his men, return
to that far-off planet where they
dwell word will be carried there of the
existence of our world. But who can
say that Teuxical ever will return here
again? It may be the whim of his
ruler to refuse his request, or any one
of a thousand other events might arise
to thwart his desire to live among us.
No,&#8221; concluded Dirk passionately, &#8220;it
never will do to let that great engine
of destruction rise into the skies
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is right!&#8221; asserted Steinholt
positively. &#8220;It will be far better to
annihilate these raiders, if such a thing
can be accomplished!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lazarre was rather inclined to take
sides with Fragoni.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;can such
destruction be brought about? We
know nothing of the capabilities of
that monster that is lying down there
in the Sound. It is undoubtedly
equipped with the deadliest of devices
and they all will be turned upon us if
we fail in an effort to destroy the thing
and those who have come from space
upon it. If there was a way to smite
them suddenly, to bring death to the
Lodorians and to those swarming,
mindless, murderous minions who act
in obedience to them, I would favor
doing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, as it is,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;it
seems like inviting disaster even to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
think of such an attempt, much less to
try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be done, though,&#8221; asserted
Dirk, &#8220;or there is at least a fighting
chance of accomplishing it. The electrosceotan&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
He paused, and looked
questioningly at Steinholt. &#8220;The top
of that monster is open and....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> Teuton furrowed his brow
and considered the proposition for
a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, nodding his head, &#8220;it
might be done.&#8221; Again he silently
gave the subject his thought. &#8220;It is
well worth trying,&#8221; he asserted with an
air of decision. &#8220;But we will have to
make haste,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;if the thing
is to be done before the flight to The
Hague.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So be it,&#8221; said Fragoni. &#8220;We will
apply ourselves to the task at hand. I,
too,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;had rather see
these vandals destroyed like so much
vermin rather than have them carry the
news of the existence of this earth
back into those strange worlds in the
depth of space. I will only regret the
passing of Teuxical, who could have
taught us much wisdom. And now,&#8221; he
continued briskly, &#8220;I will place myself
under your orders, Dirk. You are the
one who suggested this plan and upon
you will fall the responsibility of
executing it. And, if it succeeds,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;the glory will be yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I care little for the glory,&#8221; replied
Dirk, &#8220;but I gladly accept the duties
and the responsibilities. These,&#8221; he
said to Fragoni, &#8220;are my instructions
to you. Inasmuch as Teuxical and his
captains will return here at about four
o&#8217;clock in the morning to convey us
back to their craft, it will be necessary
to have this building emptied of
its inhabitants by that time. Let all
of those who dwell here depart from it,
a few at a time, so as not to excite
suspicion. Inga, above all others, must
leave and retreat to a place of safety.
Then, as the hour approaches for the
arrival of the Lodorians, we will escape
by plane from one of the rear terraces.
They will land in search of us and&ndash;&ndash;well,
then they will feel the force of
our power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will follow your orders explicitly,&#8221;
promised Fragoni. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;where Stanton is? He should
be advised of what we are going to
attempt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will return in due time,&#8221; replied
Dirk. &#8220;And, if not, it will be the
worse for him. Lazarre will remain
here with you,&#8221; he then told Fragoni,
&#8220;and Steinholt and I will now go about
our part of the task at hand.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span>, followed by Steinholt, hurried
across the terrace and, leaving
the shelter of its quartzite plates,
sought the landing stage.</p>
<p>The rain still was falling and the
heavens were congested with dark and
heavy clouds.</p>
<p>Dirk, selecting one of the smaller
planes, entered the cabin and Steinholt,
following after him, closed the
door and threw on the lights.</p>
<p>Swiftly they shot straight up into
the air, Dirk ignoring all of the rules
of flight in his haste to be under way.
Once in the westbound lane, he
headed his plane toward Manhattan
and threw his rheostat wide open. In
a few minutes they were skimming
over the great city and past the three-thousand-foot
steel tower of the
Worldwide Broadcasting Station.</p>
<p>For fifteen minutes more he kept the
plane on a straight course and then,
bringing it to a quick stop, he let it
drop like a plummet toward the earth.</p>
<p>It landed, among many other planes,
on the transparent, quartzite roof of a
vast building and, looking down into
the interior, they could see several
rows of great dynamos. Some of them
were turning, and the humming that
they made could be heard plainly.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> and Steinholt ran rapidly
across the roof until they came
to a superstructure, which they entered.
There was a shaft inside. Dirk
pressed a button, and an elevator shot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
up and stopped at the door, which
automatically flashed open.</p>
<p>He closed it after he and his companion
had entered the cage and, dropping
rapidly downward, they came to
a stop in a lighted chamber that was
far below the surface of the ground.</p>
<p>A stoop-shouldered old man greeted
them, an expression of surprise on his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What
is&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Power, Gaeble!&#8221; commanded Steinholt
tensely. &#8220;Power! Let every
dynamo run its swiftest. To-night we
have to use for the electrosceotan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought it was peace that
those from the stars desired,&#8221; said the
old electrician. &#8220;Through my radiovisor
I heard&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was sent out,&#8221; explained Steinholt,
&#8220;to relieve the fears of the people
and to keep them in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly the distorted figure of the
old man sped to a great switchboard,
where he pressed button after button.</p>
<p>The very ground commenced to vibrate
around them and the massive
structure seemed to be alive with
straining power.</p>
<p>Then Steinholt, going to a corner of
the intricate board, adjusted a few
levers, while his gnomelike companion
watched him carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Gaeble,&#8221; the scientist said
impressively, &#8220;these are your orders.
At precisely the hour of four o&#8217;clock
in the morning make one connection
with this switch.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> indicated, with a stubby finger,
the lever to be operated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the circuit closed for just
four seconds,&#8221; he added slowly, &#8220;and
then break it. Do you understand,
Gaeble?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; continued Steinholt, &#8220;after
you break that connection you quickly
will close this next circuit. Keep it
closed for four seconds and then, after
opening it for one second, close it
again for four seconds. Repeat the
procedure twice more, Gaeble, after
that, and then await my further instructions.
Is everything clear?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, sir,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;I
will follow your orders implicitly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one thing more,&#8221; Steinholt
said. &#8220;Get the Worldwide Tower on
the televisor and warn them of what is
to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do that immediately,&#8221; Gaeble
replied.</p>
<p>Dirk and Steinholt shot up to the
roof again and the building over which
they walked seemed to be quivering
with life.</p>
<p>They could see that all of the mammoth
dynamos beneath them were revolving
and the humming which they
had heard before had changed into an
ugly, vibrant roar.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Again</span> they took flight and, reaching
Manhattan, they continued
north and east to the shore of Long
Island Sound.</p>
<p>Long before the old East River had
been filled in and the space which it
had occupied reclaimed for building
purposes. All indications of its former
bed had been obliterated by mammoth
terraced structures.</p>
<p>When they reached their destination
on the shore of the Sound a small submarine,
which Dirk had ordered by
radio, was awaiting them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Submerge and proceed up the
Sound,&#8221; Dirk ordered the officer, &#8220;and
take us directly under the craft of the
Lodorians.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes they were skimming
over the surface of the water and,
when a sufficient depth had been
gained, the tiny boat disappeared beneath
the rain-rippled sea.</p>
<p>Dirk sat at a port and watched the
aquatic life as it was illuminated by
the powerful aquamarine searchlights.</p>
<p>Progress under the water was comparatively
slow, as mankind had made
but little progress in underwater navigation.
Air liners long before had almost
superseded travel by land and sea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
and the abolition of warfare had swept
all of the old navies from the ocean.</p>
<p>It was more than an hour before the
officer in charge of the boat announced
that the mammoth hull of the monster
that was lying on the Sound was
visible directly above them.</p>
<p>Both Dirk and Steinholt donned
diving apparatus, and the former carefully
adjusted the mechanism that was
contained in a metallic box about two
feet square.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Then</span> they stepped up into a
chamber in the conning tower of
the boat and, after a door slipped shut
beneath them, water slowly commenced
to pour into the compartment.</p>
<p>When it was full a sliding door that
was in front of them slowly opened
and they passed out onto the deck of
the underwater craft.</p>
<p>Steinholt had been provided with
some welding apparatus and, in a few
minutes, the box which Dirk had carried
was attached securely to the bottom
of the craft of the Lodorians.</p>
<p>They then reentered the submarine
by reversing the process which had
attended their exit. Very soon they
were in the cabin of the boat again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If everything goes well,&#8221; said
Dirk, &#8220;those damned Lodorians will
never know what struck them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only hope,&#8221; said Steinholt, &#8220;that
we don&#8217;t destroy that leviathan altogether.
We might solve the secret of
it and then we, too, could ride out into
the heart of the universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible to imagine what
will happen,&#8221; Dirk replied, &#8220;until after
we launch our attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of the men were silent during
the return trip of the small undersea
craft, which emerged at its dock a little
before three-thirty in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to hurry,&#8221; urged Dirk
nervously, &#8220;because we will need a little
time to make preparations after we
get back to Fragoni&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered their plane and Dirk
shot it swiftly up into the night, following
the red shaft of light that rose
almost directly from the point at which
they had made their landing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Then</span>, having reached the eastbound
level, he headed straight in
the direction of the palace of Fragoni.</p>
<p>Dirk cast a glance at the great city
that lay far beneath him. High up into
the heavens it tossed the <a name='TC_37'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'fulgerant'">fulgurant</ins> fires
that betokened its wealth and power.
And, down among those myriad lights,
millions and millions of people were
restless under the danger that menaced
them. It was only a matter of moments
now before their fate, and the
fate of their great metropolis, would
be decided. By dawn they would be
free forever from the threat of subjugation
and slavery or else they, and
all that they had toiled and striven for,
would be the veriest dust of dying
embers.</p>
<p>And whatever befell them likewise
would befall the rest of the world and
every living thing that moved upon it.</p>
<p>Dirk was high above Fragoni&#8217;s when
he stopped the forward flight of the
plane and, dropping it rapidly through
the misty night, brought up easily on
the landing stage. The other planes
which had been there when he and
Steinholt had taken their departure
were gone and Dirk felt a sense of relief
when he observed this. Inga, then,
must have departed with the other occupants
of the colossal structure.
Things were going according to the
plan that he had conceived. He stepped
out of the cabin, followed by Steinholt,
and proceeded hastily along the terrace
and turned the corner into the garden.</p>
<p>Then he came to an abrupt halt because
there, before him, was Zitlan,
with one of the deadly ray-tubes of the
Lodorians in his <a name='TC_49'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'head'">hand</ins>.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> knew immediately that something
unexpected had happened
and that he was in the power of one
who not only hated him but who had
an unholy desire for Inga.</p>
<p>He realized, too, that any show of
resistance would be nothing short of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
suicide, for he was well aware of the
deadliness of the strange weapon with
which he and Steinholt were being
menaced by the gloating Lodorian.</p>
<p>&#8220;One false move and you die!&#8221;
warned Zitlan. &#8220;Come forward, now,
and join those two others over whom
Anteucan and Huazibar are watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk and Steinholt promptly obeyed
the command of Zitlan and walked
over to where Fragoni and <a name='TC_38'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Lizarre'">Lazarre</ins>
were being guarded by two of the conquerors.</p>
<p>The rain had ceased to fall, but the
skies were dark and overcast with
heavy clouds. There was an occasional
flash of lightning, and thunder rolled
and echoed through the night.</p>
<p>The terrace, however, was brightly
illuminated and every detail of the
scene around him was visible to Dirk.</p>
<p>He saw Stanton, on another part of
the terrace, standing among some
Lodorians he had not seen before.
Stanton, apparently, was not being
treated as a prisoner and Dirk wondered,
rather vaguely, why this was.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Dirk asked
Fragoni quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to what I have heard,&#8221;
the latter replied, &#8220;Zitlan murdered his
father in a fit of rage, and has taken
over the command of the ship. Many
of the Lodorians are his adherents and
even those who do not favor him are
so terrified that they will be obedient
to his wishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And <a name='TC_39'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'Igna'">Inga</ins>?&#8221; questioned Dirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is inside the apartment,&#8221; said
Fragoni, a note of desperation in his
voice. &#8220;Zitlan surprised us completely
and he and his men had us covered before we
realized that Teuxical was not
among them.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Zitlan</span>, in the meantime, had entered
the suite of Fragoni and he
now came out, Inga walking before
him.</p>
<p>She was silent and proudly erect but
there was a pallor in her face that indicated
her realization of the danger
that she was threatened with.</p>
<p>When Dirk saw her she gave him a
brave smile, which he answered with a
glance of reassurance.</p>
<p>He could see the great clock in
the Metropole Tower, and he noticed,
with a feeling of grave apprehension,
that it was twenty minutes to four
o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>There were only a few minutes more
in which to make a desperate and apparently
a hopeless effort to save Inga,
his friends and himself from a catastrophe
which he had been instrumental
in contriving.</p>
<p>Then Zitlan stood before him,
haughty and arrogant, his lowering
countenance ugly with hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, dog,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you who dared
to defy Zitlan now stand before him
a captive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Dirk nor any one of the
three others who were guarded with
him replied to the utterance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and that woman of yours,&#8221; continued
the Lodorian insolently, &#8220;both
are my prisoners to do with as I please.
Your fate,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I already
have planned for you and I assure you
that it will not be as pleasurable as
the one to which she is destined. You
will find that Tigana, on which you and
those with you will be cast, is a world
of terror such as you never could
dream of. Even the monsters which
crawl through the deliriums of the
mind are not as horrible as those which
infest the mad and haunted world of
which I speak.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> paused a moment, a cruel smile
on his face, as if he wished the
full import of his words to sear themselves
into the minds of the doomed
men.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the woman,&#8221; he added, &#8220;will return
to Lodore with me and be the
queen of all women. And soon,&#8221; he
said savagely, &#8220;she may be queen of all
Lodore, of the worlds which pay
tribute to Lodore, and of other worlds
which I will conquer and ravage. My
father stood in my way and he died at
my own hands. So will others perish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
who thwart my ambition, and I will become
supreme in the universe!&#8221;</p>
<p>A feeling of reckless fury possessed
Dirk as he listened to the words of
Zitlan and he felt an almost irresistible
desire to drive a fist square between
the mad, glittering eyes of the
Lodorian.</p>
<p>He glanced at the great clock, however,
and he saw that the time to act
had not yet come. At the last moment
he would make one desperate attempt
to frustrate the evil designs of Zitlan.
If it failed&ndash;&ndash;well, all would be lost.
But it was a far better thing to die resisting
the despicable Zitlan and his
minions than it would be to live and
to know that, without a struggle, he
had abandoned to degradation the girl
he loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;This world of yours will be my
world,&#8221; he heard Zitlan boast, &#8220;and the
spoils from it will add to my riches.
This one here,&#8221; he continued, indicating
Stanton, &#8220;has offered to show me
where all of the treasures of the earth
may be found. And, as a reward, he
will return to Lodore with me and
there be elevated to a high position.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">That</span>, then, was why Stanton was
not under guard like the rest of
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our good friend, Stanton,&#8221; said
Lazarre, &#8220;seems to have become something
of a Judas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And let his name be forever cursed,
like the name of Judas,&#8221; said Dirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; thundered the Lodorian.
&#8220;I, Zitlan, am speaking.&#8221; He paused
a moment. &#8220;When I garner up the
treasures of this world in the way of
precious stones and metals I also shall
gather more priceless loot in the way
of women. And then, having taken all
that I desire, I will lay waste to this
earth so that those who survive will
fear the name of Zitlan and will grovel
before him like a god when once again
he appears to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Zitlan had been speaking,
Dirk had been studying the opponents
with whom he soon had to clash.</p>
<p>The two Lodorians who were standing
guard over himself and his companions
were close to his left side.
Zitlan was directly in front of him,
and there were seven of his minions
clustered behind him.</p>
<p>Again Dirk glanced at the great
dial of the clock, and he saw that it was
seven minutes of four.</p>
<p>The moment had come to act if action
was to prove of any avail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the words of Zitlan were interrupted
by Dirk, who suddenly made a
mighty sweep with his left arm and
knocked the deadly tubes from the
hands of Anteucan and Huazibar.
Startled by the assault, they went reeling
backward. At almost the same
instant Dirk leaped forward and, seizing
Zitlan, hurled him among those
Lodorians who had been massed behind
him. Then he threw himself violently
into the tangled mass, his fists driving
in and out with deadly strength!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Out</span> of the corner of one eye he saw
Inga pass the melee and dart
swiftly to the corner of the terrace.
Instead of passing around to the landing
stage, however, she lingered there
and watched the combat.</p>
<p>Dirk, as he fought, became conscious
that Steinholt and Fragoni were at his
side, battling with him against his
enemies. He saw, too, that Stanton had
retired to the far end of the terrace
and that he was watching the struggle
with frightened eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must reach the plane and get
away,&#8221; gasped Dirk. &#8220;In another three
minutes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He felled a Lodorian who, having
lost his tube, was about to grapple with
him. He saw Steinholt send another
one of their opponents reeling backward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fragoni!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;The
plane! Get in with Inga! We will
come!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke his fists were
flailing back and forth between each
one of his <a name='TC_40'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'stacatto'">staccato</ins> commands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span></div>
<p>He saw beneath him a hand reaching
toward a tube, and he kicked the instrument
of death. It hurtled over in
the direction of Stanton and landed
close to his feet. Stanton might have
picked it up and been in possession of
the means of aiding his old friends or
his new allies. But he shrunk away,
panic-stricken, from the thing that lay
so close to his reach.</p>
<p>A Lodorian leaped upon Dirk&#8217;s back
in an effort to bring him to the ground,
but he stooped swiftly forward and his
assailant was catapulted over his head
into those who were in front of him.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">He</span> caught a flash of the contorted
face of Zitlan flying through the
air, and saw him land with a crash on
the terrace, and lie there writhing in
pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steinholt, Lazarre!&#8221; he said convulsively.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to strike once
more! And then&ndash;&ndash;run!&#8221;</p>
<p>He plunged into their enemies with
every bit of energy that he had left,
and saw two of them toppling down.
Then, like a flash, he turned to Lazarre,
who was trying to fight off three of the
Lodorians. Seizing one of them by the
waist, Dirk hurled him backward and
he disposed of another one in the same
manner. His sheer desperation seemed
to have given him unbounded strength
and power.</p>
<p>Lazarre sent his third opponent
down with a blow under the chin and
then, with Dirk at his side, they turned
to the assistance of Steinholt.</p>
<p>With one mad rush they crashed into
a group of Lodorians and sent them
reeling away like so many nine-pins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now! To the plane!&#8221; exclaimed
Dirk, taking to his heels across the terrace.
Steinholt and Lazarre followed
after him and, turning the corner, they
saw that the ship was in place and that
Fragoni was anxiously waiting by the
door of the cabin. Inga, Dirk knew,
already was inside and safe. He stood
aside while Steinholt and Lazarre
leaped in. During the momentary wait
he caught a glimpse of the great clock.
It was one minute to four. Dirk jumping
into the plane and switched on the
helicopter without even waiting to
close the cabin door.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> ship shot skyward like a
rocket. When it reached an altitude
of thirty-five hundred feet, he
turned it north and raced at top speed
in that direction.</p>
<p>It was miles away from the palace of
Fragoni in less than thirty seconds.
Dirk then stopped the plane and held
it poised in the air with the helicopter.</p>
<p>The skies were turgid and black and
the massed clouds, reflecting the lights
of the great city below them, were
permeated with an ugly, feverish, red
glow.</p>
<p>From where they were hanging in
midair, the occupants of the plane
could plainly see the sparkling palace
of Fragoni towering high up into the
darkness of the night.</p>
<p>The lights of the magnificent mansion
were reflected far out into the
Sound where, looming in the golden
ripples, lay the sinister monster from
the terrible depths of unfathomable
space.</p>
<p>Dirk took a watch from his pocket
and, after glancing at it, he hastily replaced
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two seconds more,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A sharp</span> and dazzling bolt of
greenish fire came hurling suddenly
out of the west and, with a
thunderous concussion, seemed to
fasten itself on the crest of Fragoni&#8217;s
palace.</p>
<p>It trembled and quivered, as if endowed
with some uncanny life and
power, as it remained there against the
darkness, throwing a weird, green tinge
over the water and up into the skies.</p>
<p>Blue waves of light could be seen
pulsing and racing along the terrible
beam and there, where it had fastened
itself, they seemed to disappear in the
vast and crumbling structure.</p>
<p>For four seconds that destructive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
streak of light, one end of which was
lost back in the mists that concealed
Manhattan, tore at the proud pile.</p>
<p>And, as the stone crumbled and the
steelite fused under the mighty assault,
an ominous roar swept through
the night. The air was so violently
agitated that the plane, miles away,
tossed up and down like a tiny boat on
a stormy sea.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the bolt was gone,
but its livid image still burned in the
eyes of those who had been watching
it.</p>
<p>Once more, it came hurling out of
the west and, like the fang of some
great and deadly serpent, darted into
the monster that lay in the waters of
the Sound.</p>
<p>Dirk and his companions could see
plainly, by the light of the bolt itself,
that it had crashed into the well from
which the Lodorians first had appeared,
and that it was beating and hammering
its way into the very vitals of the craft.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dazzling</span>, blinding fire seemed
to pour from the aperture
through which the bolt had passed.
The clamor that arose was deafening.</p>
<p>Then again the streak of fires was
withdrawn, leaving the night intensely
black until, in a moment more, it came
thundering out of the west again and,
with an impact that made the land and
the sea and the very heavens tremble,
hurled its way into the depths of the
doomed leviathan.</p>
<p>Twice again it fell, a fiery scimitar
out of the darkness, and twice again
it careened at the vitals of the stricken
monster.</p>
<p>Then, after the assault was over, the
ship still floated on the surface of the
Sound and its shell, as far as Dirk and
the others could judge, still was unscathed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will soon know our fate,&#8221; remarked
Steinholt calmly. &#8220;If that
didn&#8217;t kill those beasts we might as
well give up our ghosts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop the plane a little lower and
a little nearer to the ship,&#8221; said Dirk.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that any life is surviving
in that thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My beautiful palace is nothing but
dust,&#8221; sighed Fragoni, mournfully.
&#8220;And all my beautiful treasures, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that beautiful Zitlan,&#8221; Lazarre
reminded him, &#8220;and his beautiful boy
friends, they are all dust too, thank
God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a queer fate that Stanton
met,&#8221; suggested Dirk. &#8220;He thought
that he would save his life by going
over to our enemies, and, instead of
that, he lost it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class="drop">P</span><span class="dcap">oor</span> Stanton,&#8221; said Steinholt.
&#8220;He was born that way, I suppose,
and I, for one, am ready to forgive
and forget him. And now,&#8221; continued
the Teuton, &#8220;I hope that we
didn&#8217;t do too much damage to that little
boat of the Lodorians. If we could
get just a little peep at the inside of
it we might learn the secret of its contrivance.
And then, my friends, we
could do a little journeying ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any theory regarding it?&#8221;
asked Fragoni.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teuxical intimated that it rode the
magnetic currents which, of course,
flow through all the suns and planets
in the universe,&#8221; replied Steinholt.
&#8220;We have been working along that line
ourselves, of course, and it probably
won&#8217;t be very long anyway before we
have the solution of interplanetary travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those Lodorians would have solved
it for us if it hadn&#8217;t been for that artificial
lightning,&#8221; said Lazarre. &#8220;That&#8217;s
powerful stuff, Steinholt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, with that three-thousand-foot
Worldwide Tower to hurl it from,&#8221;
agreed Steinholt, &#8220;we can get fair
range with it. If the Lodorians hadn&#8217;t
left the well of their ship open, though,
the lightning wouldn&#8217;t have done us
much good. I was afraid, too, for a
time, that we might have trouble in
welding that automatic wireless circuit
box to the bottom of the ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk, in the meantime, had brought
the plane down to within a half-mile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
of the leviathan, and he was holding
it poised there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; he said, after scrutinizing
the monster for a couple of
minutes, &#8220;that it is moving in the water.
It is!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Steinholt!
Look!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Only</span> a comparatively short time
had elapsed since the last bolt of
lightning had vanished back into the
darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is still rocking with the force
of the shock that we gave it,&#8221; asserted
Steinholt. &#8220;You would be rocking, too,
if you had been tickled by a bolt like
that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rising, I tell you!&#8221; said Dirk.
&#8220;The front end of it is slowly getting
higher in the water!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Dirk,&#8221; said Fragoni,
excitement straining his voice. &#8220;Look!
It just dropped back into the water!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as they watched, the movements
of the leviathan became more
and more agitated, until it was churning
up the waves around it like a
wounded and agonized monster of the
sea.</p>
<p>Suddenly the front end tilted upward
and the monster rose clear of the water.
It shot straight up into the air at
a speed so terrific that they could
scarcely follow it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; gasped Fragoni. &#8220;Those
brainless, mindless automatons must
have survived!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; remarked Steinholt thoughtfully.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that there is
any life left on that thing. No one
had closed the well when it rose, and
it would mean death to go out into
space with the ship in that condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what made it go up?&#8221; demanded
Lazarre. &#8220;Can the damn thing run
itself, Steinholt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine,&#8221; recalled the Teuton,
&#8220;that our bolts killed every living thing
that was on the craft but that, at the
same time, they set the mechanism of
the monster into action. Ah,&#8221; he
moaned, &#8220;but that is too bad. We could
have learned much by an examination
of the interior of that liner of the air.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">A cry</span> from Inga startled them and
they saw that she was looking
skyward, with terror in her eyes.</p>
<p>They followed her gaze and there,
streaking through the black clouds,
they saw a long trail of white fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that thing!&#8221; exclaimed Fragoni.
&#8220;I tell you that those upon it still live
and that they are about to wreak vengeance
upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Steinholt positively. &#8220;You
are wrong, Fragoni. What is happening
may be almost as disastrous,
though,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;That leviathan
is in its death agonies; it is a
metal monster gone mad, and none can
say what will happen before it expires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The place for us,&#8221; asserted Dirk
hurriedly, &#8220;is in the Worldwide Tower.
<a name='TC_42'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Removed extra quote">There</ins> we can keep track of what is
transpiring and try to decide what to
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others agreed with him and,
seeking the westward level of flight, he
sped the plane in the direction of the
mammoth pyramid from which the
news of the world was broadcast.</p>
<p>They reached the vast structure in a
few minutes, and, after dropping the
plane on a landing stage, they went
into the operating room.</p>
<p>Here they learned quickly that the
craft of the Lodorians was doing incalculable
damage, and that it was
throwing the population of the world
into an unprecedented panic.</p>
<p>It was, apparently, following an erratic,
uncertain orbit that took it far
out into space and then back quite
close to the surface of the earth again.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It</span> had passed through the very heart
of Chicago within a few yards of
the ground, and it had cut and burned
a swath more than a mile wide through
the buildings of that metropolis.</p>
<p>Other cities in America had felt the
devastating effects of its <a name='TC_43'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'irresisible'">irresistible</ins>
and molten heat and, within a short
time, thousands of people had been
slain by it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span></div>
<p>Time and again, from the terrace of
the great tower, Dirk and his companions
saw the skies above them light up
as that terrible, blazing, projectile
which, uncontrolled, went hurtling on
its way through the night.</p>
<p>For three hours it careened on its
mad course and hysteria reigned
throughout the cities of the whole
civilized world.</p>
<p>But then a report came from a
rocket-liner that had left Berlin en
route for San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either a great meteor or that leviathan
of the Lodorians just swept down
past us in mid-Atlantic and plunged
into the sea. Apparently it has exploded,
for it has thrown a great column
of water for miles up into the air. We
are stopping and standing by, although
the heat is intense and clouds of steam
are rising from the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the minutes passed by after the
report from the rocket-ship had been
received, the disappearance from the
sky of the flaming craft from space
seemed to confirm the belief that it
had been swallowed by the ocean. This
was accepted as a certainty by eight
o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; sighed Steinholt, &#8220;if only it
had crashed on land somewhere. If
there only was enough of it left for
us to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough of any damn contraption of
that kind,&#8221; swore Lazarre fervently, &#8220;is
altogether too much. I hope, for one,
that its fragments are scattered so far
that we never can put them together
again.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Dirk</span> and Inga leaned against one
of the parapets that evening on a
gardened terrace of his own great mansion
in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Their little party had gone there
after leaving the Worldwide Tower in
the morning.</p>
<p>After resting during the day, Lazarre
and Fragoni were somewhere together,
discussing the plans for a new
palace to take the place of the one
that was destroyed so that Zitlan and
his minions might die in its ruins.</p>
<p>Steinholt, elsewhere, was delving
into oceanography and submarine engineering,
in an attempt to learn
whether or not it would be feasible to
fish for the remains of the lost ship
of Lodore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems like a dream, doesn&#8217;t it,
Dirk?&#8221; the girl remarked. &#8220;It is difficult
to believe that we actually have
seen and talked with people from some
far-away world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they looked up into the
crystalline skies, where mazes of shining
stars gave testimony to the countless
worlds which were wheeling
around them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And just to think, Dirk,&#8221; Inga continued
proudly, &#8220;that it was you who
saved this world and all of its people
from that horrible Zitlan and his
horde.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saved you,&#8221; he told her gravely
and tenderly, &#8220;and that somehow means
more to me than saving all of this
world and all of the other worlds which
are rolling through the uncharted ways
of time and space.&#8221;</p>
